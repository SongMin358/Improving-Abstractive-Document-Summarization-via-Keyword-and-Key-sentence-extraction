        "document": "The Australian businessman charged with horrific acts of child abuse acted as the ring leader of an international paedophile ring that served Australian clients, according to investigators. Peter Gerard Scully's latest alleged victim, a 13 year-old girl, has told police she was supposed to meet one of the disgraced businessman's Australian clients and carry out lewd sex acts on camera. However, the girl told investigators plans were changed at late notice and Scully tried to sell her to a German man for the equivalent of $2924 instead,\u00a0The Age reports. Peter Gerard Scully alleged operated\u00a0an  international paedophile ring that served Australian clients, according to AFP investigators. Scully's alleged crimes are so heinous they have led to renewed calls to reintroduce the death penalty. Videos seized in the Philippines last week allegedly show the 13-year-old girl being forced to perform lewd acts with a baby aged one and girl toddler aged five, according to investigators. The videos shows whipping and torture along with other horrific acts, and was described by police as the most shocking child pornography that has ever been discovered in the Philippines. His alleged victim was also forced to call him 'Uncle Peter' and started working for him, after he had promised to cover her schooling costs. 'Because (he) pay a big amount that's why I had to do that,' the girl said. It is claimed Scully abused more than a dozen children in the three years he was in the Philippines, during which time he moved house frequently and assembled a team of more than four foreign accomplices and half a dozen Filipino workers in a lucrative 'pay for view' online child pornography business. Peter Gerald Scully (right) was arrested for human trafficking and child porn-related offences arising from his alleged sexual abuse of Filipino girls\u00a0which was filmed and then posted online for paying clients . Reportedly, Scully slipped out of Melbourne and fled to Manila in 2011 after he allegedly scammed more than $2.68 million from 20 investors in an investment scheme. The 52-year-old was under investigation from 2009 by the Australian Securities and Investment Commission but avoided being charged with 117 fraud and deception offences, having departed Victoria. He returned to Australia  accompanied by a  Malaysian teenager named Ling in 2011, who was believed to be his 'girlfriend' before he turned her into a prostitute, associates claim. 'Because (he) pay a big amount that's why I had to do that,' his alleged victim told police investigators. The allegations emerged after the father-of-two was arrested last month after the body of a teenage girl was found buried under a house he rented in Malaybalay, Bukidnon. He was formally charged on Friday. The Age reports Scully was never charged with child sex crimes in Victoria but a number of associates claimed he had a horrific sexual history. An unnamed former business associate, who lost more than $200,000 in the fraudulent scheme, told The Age he was neither surprised about the recent charges laid against Scully. 'Does it surprise me?' the associate told The Age. 'Yes and no. The signs were always there for him, but it's gone to a dark place.' Agent Janet Francisco (right) , who was responsible for cracking the case and the rescue of several victims from Scully's house, is pictured with one of the rescued girls (left) A search warrant was issued for his arrest in 2012 but Scully remained in the Philippines, where he allegedly\u00a0established a lucrative business live-streaming videos in a 'pay for view' scheme. Police alleged Scully would undertake acts in response to requests from his clients from across the globe, who paid to live-stream videos of children being tortured and sexually abused. It has sparked such an outrage in the Philippines that calls are growing daily to have him executed. The death penalty was suspended in the Philippines in 2006, but an influential conservative politician told\u00a0The Sydney Morning Herald that the Australian's alleged crimes were so depraved he should be put to death. 'The Philippine government should directly and seriously address the problem of paedophilia, child exploitation and sexual abuse by supporting the move to reimpose the death penalty,' Nationalist People's Coalition MP Sherwin Gatchalian said. The remains of a 10-year-old girl were found at a home formerly rented by Scully after he was arrested . Scully avoided arrest until February 20 this year before\u00a0a former partner told police that Scully had killed one of his child victims in 2013. It was after this shocking revelation that the remains of a 10-year-old girl were found at a home formerly rented by Scully. An extremely graphic and distressing account by two young girls, who survived the trauma of Scully's alleged torturous abuse, paints a horrifying picture of what at least a dozen children are alleged to have endured in his home. Cousins, going by the name of Daisy,11, and\u00a0and Queenie, 10, told rappler news site about the fateful day in September 2014 when they were approached by Scully's live-in partner, Carme Ann 'Angel' Alvarez. Alvarez, who was only 17 at the time and an alleged former victim of Scully's, offered the girls food at Centrio Mall in Cagayan de Oro City and then invited them back to their house. Daisy said when they got to the house, Alvarez bathed the girls while Scully, who she referred to as the 'American', videoed them. The next morning the girls were asked to start digging a hole in the ground but had no idea why they had been asked to do the unusual task. It was then after lunch that things became even more disturbing when allegedly Scully undressed the girls and told them to kiss each other.

        "document": "(CNN)A lot of people have ventured to Paraguay over the years in search of some sort of a dream. My great-great-grandfather, Jean Bourdain, was one of them. I've looked for this mysterious ancestor before -- in Uruguay, with my younger brother Chris. We were disappointed when our trail ran cold. We were left with a cryptic reference to the news that Jean had died in Asuncion, Paraguay. Which raised the questions: \"What the hell was he doing in Paraguay?\" And \"Where is Paraguay, anyway?\" Roots: Our Journeys Home . It's certainly a country few of us know much about. Landlocked by its better-known neighbors, Paraguay is probably best known for being a hideout for escaped Nazis and for a succession of truly spectacularly lurid, out-of-a-comic-book dictatorships -- the last being the administration of Gen. Alfredo Stroessner. It's certainly a country few of us know much about. Landlocked by its better-known neighbors, Paraguay is probably best known for being a hideout for escaped Nazis and for a succession of truly spectacularly lurid, out-of-a-comic-book dictatorships -- the last being the administration of Gen. Alfredo Stroessner. When I first looked at the possibility of making a television show there, many years ago, descriptions of the country by visitors were not promising: crime, corruption, counterfeiters, failed institutions, looted banks -- in short, a backwater. I thought I'd use the dubious quest for \"The Missing Bourdain\" as the spine of a show, a framework to investigate one of the least-known nations in the Americas. My crew, looking at various storytelling structures, settled on the terrific film \"The Limey\" as a rough template. In that film, Terence Stamp, playing a just-out-of-prison career criminal, voyages to Los Angeles in search of answers after the death of his daughter. In this week's \"Parts Unknown\" episode, I explore Paraguay (and my family's past) in similar nonlinear fashion. It's an amazing-looking show. Everybody who worked on it, handcrafted it, is convinced it's some of their best work. What I found out -- about Paraguay, about my family -- surprised me. I hope it entertains you.",

        "document": "A bank worker tried to murder his topless masseuse girlfriend after he quit his job to start a business with her but then became jealous when a man smiled at her in a club. Amish Kansagra opened a massage parlour with his Polish lover Anna Imporowicz, but he was angry that she attracted interest from other men, including her ex-boyfriend. The couple fell out when a man smiled at Miss Imporowicz in a salsa club - and the next day Kansagra turned up at her home and stabbed her in the throat, saying: 'You will die today.' He was today convicted of attempted murder at Kingston-upon-Thames Crown Court, after a jury heard he had 'eyes like the devil' during his violent rampage. Attack: Amish Kansagra, left, tried to murder his masseuse girlfriend Anna Imporowicz, right . Judge Susan Tapping said that Kansagra, 28, would face a 'lengthy sentence' for the crime after being found guilty. The couple first started dating when Kansagra became a regular client of Miss Imporowicz, 35, who would give massages to naked customers while she was topless or wearing skimpy underwear. He left his job at a bank and opened a massage parlour with her in Ealing, west London, but their relationship fell apart last June after the incident in a Holborn salsa club. The court heard that the pair went home together that night, but Kansagra shoved Miss Imporowicz against a fridge, destroyed her phone and laptop and posted a picture of her on Facebook with the caption: 'I'm a prostitute and proud of it.' The next day, he turned up at her house in nearby Brentford armed with a knife which he had taken from the massage parlour. Victim: Miss Imporowicz met the defendant because he was a massage customer of hers . Prosecutor Julian Jones told the jury: 'She saw Amish with the knife in his hand and he shut the kitchen window and put the knife to her throat and said, \"You've made the wrong decision. You will die today.\" 'He was trying to stab her neck and she felt him cut her neck and and she saw her blood and fell to the floor saying, \"I love you. Don't do this.\" 'She described him as having gritted teeth and eyes like the devil, and he cut her neck again, harder and deeper, and used the tip of the knife to cut her gum.' Miss Imporowicz tried to flee out of the front door, but was pulled back by the defendant, Mr Jones continued. 'He still had the knife in one hand and the other hand around her neck and stabbed her in the side. 'She escaped via a window and while she had one leg out Amish tried to stab her everywhere.' A retired nurse came to her aid, and as Kansagra fled the scene he told witnesses that Miss Imporowicz had inflicted the horrific injuries on himself. The defendant initially ran away to Manchester, but he later turned himself in to police and claimed not to remember anything thanks to a three-day vodka binge. 'He said she was the first person he had ever loved and that there was something inside him,' the prosecutor said. 'He recalled stabbing Anna in the neck and seeing the blood and confirmed he was not acting in self-defence.' Kansagra was convicted by the jury of one count of attempted murder, but was found not guilty of assaulting Miss Imporowicz. Before the trial he pleaded guilty to causing criminal damage, possessing a bladed article and inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent. Kansagra was remanded in custody for sentencing on March 19.",

        "document": "Fans of Chelsea, Blackburn and Wigan may be shocked to learn that unheralded striker Franco di Santo is currently one of the hottest properties in Germany's Bundesliga with Werder Bremen where he has scored 12 goals in his last 18 matches. Even more surprising is the Argentine's views on the respective merits of the two leagues. Contrary to popular belief, the 25-year-old insists players in Germany are made to train harder than their Premier League counterparts and that games are more intense and competitive in the Bundesliga. A few months ago, Di Santo's opinions might have been ridiculed but given the dismal performances of English clubs in Europe this season, it appears he may have a point. Franco di Santo is loving life in the Bundesliga with Werder Bremen after stints with three English clubs . The Argentine striker moved to England with Chelsea but also played for Blackburn and Wigan . Following Chelsea's exit against Paris Saint-Germain, it is unlikely any Premier League will be in the quarter-finals of the Champions League, with Manchester City and Arsenal both losing their first leg matches at home. In contrast, Bayern Munich are safely through to the last eight with Borussia Dortmund and Bayer Leverkusen having a great chance of joining them from the Bundesliga next week. Their fourth representative Schalke gave Real Madrid an almighty scare at the Bernabeu before going out 5-4 on aggregate. 'When I came to Germany, I thought it would be a little bit less intense than the Premier League,' admitted di Santo, who signed for Bremen on a Bosman free following Wigan's relegation in 2013. 'But when I got here and felt the intensity, it was like \u201cWow\u201d. Everything is fast just like in England but sometimes I feel there is more pressure here. In the English league, you have time to turn around and go against the defender face-to-face, but here it is always pressure, pressure, pressure. Di Santo says he thought it would be a little bit less intense than the Premier League but he was surprised . Di Santo says that after a career as a young player in the Premier League he finds the Bundesliga as intense . 'The other thing that is different is the kind of training. Here, we train twice-a-day two or three times a week. It was hard for me coming from English football where you sometimes have two days free in a week. 'Here it is impossible to do that. Maybe you have one day off every two weeks. The philosophy is completely different. In England, they think your body needs to rest to be fit for the game, to get it in great condition. Here it is the opposite, you have to train more. 'Sometimes it feels too much but you do feel stronger in key moments because you are training, training. When I was in England I would be a little bit more tired in the last 10 minutes. Here I feel good, so maybe for my body it is better to train!' The reputation of the Premier League has taken a nose-dive recently but Di Santo is not surprised our top clubs aren't able to dominate in the Champions League and suggests there may be a snob value towards the Bundesliga because of the dominance of Bayern Munich. The 6ft 4in centre forward has 12 goals in his last 18 games as Bremen rise up the Bundesliga table . 'I think Germany and England have the strongest two leagues but the big difference is the marketing. The Premier League has 10 years more experience in that,' he says. 'On the pitch, the Premier League is not better or quicker. 'Of course, Bayern Munich is by far the best team in Germany but it's not because the other teams are s***, it is just because they very strong. 'If Bayern came into the Premier League, they would finish top-three for sure and they could win it, why not? They have World Cup winners and players like (Arjen) Robben, (Robert) Lewandowski and (Franck) Ribery. Di Santo,  modestly for his league, believes Bayern Munich would be in the Premier League's top three . The big striker took on Chelsea and their midfield giant Nemanja Matic in pre-season. Bremen won 3-1 . 'Just because some of the other teams in Germany aren't big names, it doesn't mean they're not good. 'We played Chelsea in pre-season and beat them 3-1. OK, it was pre-season but Chelsea put out a good team and it wasn't like they were able to score 10 against us.' Di Santo, a 6ft 4in centre forward, has packed a lot of experience into his short career. He left Argentina for Chile very young and at 17 signed for Chelsea with a big reputation. It didn't quite happen for him at Stamford Bridge and he failed to score a goal for them in two seasons. 'I had to be realistic, I was competing against (Didier) Drogba, (Nicolas) Anelka, (Andriy) Shevchenko, (Claudio) Pizarro and (Salomon) Kalou for a place and they were probably better than me at the time,' he admits. 'The most time I got was 45 minutes against Aston Villa when Anelka got injured.' The presence of Didier Drogba (left), who is still Di Santo's friend, made it difficult for him to get game time . Di Santo (right) says his loan to Blackburn went well at first but then he was dropped by Sam Allardyce . Franco di Santo has hailed his Argentine international team-mate Angel di Maria as one of the top 10 players in the world. Di Maria has struggled in England, as Di Santo did, following a record \u00a359.7million summer move to Manchester United. But di Santo insists: 'Di Maria did so well in the World Cup for Argentina, it was a shame he was injured for the final against Germany otherwise the outcome might have been different, for sure. 'He is among the top 10 players in the world. His best position is on the wing, either right or left. He is quick and skilful but some players need more time to settle into a new league than others. 'I'd say (Lionel) Messi and (Cristiano) Ronaldo are on a different planet but after them, there are five or six of around the level \u2013 Sergio Aguero, Arjen Robben, Edinson Cavani, Zlatan Ibrahimovic \u2013 and di Maria.' He went on loan to Blackburn. 'I played every single game for a half a season and did really well, but didn't score - that was my big problem. I decided to stay another six months but then the manager Sam Allardyce didn't play me any more. It was weird, from amazing to becoming very hard. But I did get a goal and assist in our local derby against Burnley and they made a DVD of the match with my face on the cover!' Ironically, it was Roberto Martinez \u2013 now in charge of England's sole Europa League survivors Everton \u2013 who helped start to turn his career around by signing him for Wigan on a permanent basis in 2010. 'It was my personal decision to leave Chelsea, I still had time on my contract but needed to play. Roberto told me I was good enough to play for Argentina, he gave me confidence. And he made me think about getting into the penalty area more. Before then, I only wanted to score pretty goals, go past a lot of players. 'Now I realise if it comes off my knee, it still counts as one goal and that has helped me.' Wigan won the FA Cup \u2013 Di Santo was an unused substitute - and were relegated in the same season, and Martinez left for Everton. He signed Arouna Kone, Antolin Alcaraz, James McCarthy and Joel Robles \u2013 but not Di Santo. 'There is no problem with that, it would have been difficult to sign so many players from Wigan,' says the player. Blackburn fans mob Di Santo after he scored against Burnley and it even earned him a space on a DVD cover . Wigan lifted the FA Cup at Wembley before being relegated, although Di Santo didn't play a single minute . Instead, the forward \u2013 who won three caps for Argentina during his time at the DW Stadium \u2013 went to Bremen in northern Germany and is finally fulfilling the promise everyone predicted in his teens. His winning goal against Freiburg last weekend lifted Bremen up to eighth, just six points of a Champions League berth. Unfortunately a booking also means he is suspended for Saturday's big match against Bayern. He still keeps in touch with old Chelsea pals like Drogba and Branislav Ivanovic and friends from Wigan like Alcaraz and Maynor Figueroa. He admits though that having not been ready for English football at 17, he would fancy a return at some point to see how the intensity and hard work in the German League have helped him develop. Wigan owner Dave Whelan gets a champagne shower from Di Santo, but they would soon part company . While Di Santo is enjoying the Bundesliga, he says he fancies a shot at 'revenge' in the Premier League . 'I am happy here really, I know I am in a league that is very competitive, one of the best in the world,' he said. 'In one way I am very happy here, I am doing well and playing in a very competitive league. But for the other side I would like to have my revenge in the English League, show what I can do with the experience I now have. It may depend on Roberto Martinez or other coaches what happens! 'If I have to stay in Germany, I am going to be happy, and for the other side, if I have to go to England, I will try to do my best to show I am better than last time.' Di Santo still has friends in England from his time there and keeps contact with a few Chelsea players . Di Santo faced top players in England but says Germany's lack of big names doesn't make teams 's***'",

The Dutch Safety Board however issued a statement saying there was nothing to prove that the fragment came from the missile that brought the plane down, and that its own conclusions would be confirmed by 'multiple sources and not only from fragments'.

        "document": "Ordinary families will not have to pay a single penny of tax on their savings, George Osborne announced today. The Chancellor said he was abolishing all tax on the first \u00a31,000 of interest savers earn from their nest eggs. The move will benefit 17 million who have put aside up to around \u00a335,000. Until now, people earning less than \u00a342,700 have had to pay 20 per cent tax on the interest they get from their savings - while those on up to \u00a3150,000 have been taxed at 40 per cent. Today's announcement means 95 per cent of savers will no longer pay any tax on their savings. Mr Osborne said savers have paid tax already on the money when they earned it \u2013 they shouldn't have to pay it again. He said it meant 'tax free banking for almost the entire population\u2019. Scroll down for video . The Chancellor said he was abolishing all tax on the first \u00a31,000 of interest savers earn from their nest eggs. The move will benefit 17 million who have put aside up to around \u00a335,000 . He told MPs: \u2018With our new Personal Savings Allowance, 17 million people will see the tax on their savings not just cut, but abolished. \u2018An entire system of tax collection can be scrapped. At a stroke we create tax free banking for almost the entire population.\u2019 It is the latest in a series of measures designed to woo pensioners, who are more likely to vote and save. Mr Osborne also confirmed plans to let five million OAPs cash in their retirement deals to help people stuck on rip-off annuity rates. Mr Osborne's policy will give those who have already taken out an annuity the right to cash it in for a lump sum from April next year. He told MPs: 'We will give five million pensioners access to their annuity. For many an annuity is the right product, but for some it makes sense to access their annuity now. 'So we\u2019re changing the law to make that possible. From next year the punitive tax charge of at least 55% will be abolished. Tax will be applied only at the marginal rate. 'And we\u2019ll consult to ensure pensioners get the right guidance and advice. So freedom for five million people with an annuity.\u2019 Until now, people earning less than \u00a342,700 have had to pay 20 per cent tax on the interest they get from their savings - while those on up to \u00a3150,000 have been taxed at 40 per cent . Today\u2019s announcements offer welcome relief to millions of savers who have suffered dismal rates on Isas, savings accounts and annuities since the Bank of England base rate was slashed to 0.5 per cent just over six years ago. Families have lost as much as \u00a35,000 since rates were cut, according to a recent estimates. The average rate paid on instant access bank accounts has fallen from 3.1 per cent in September 2008 to just 0.78 per cent now. Average Isa rates have also fallen from 1.99 per cent in March 2009 to 1.45 per cent. Savers will also benefit from a 'radically more flexible Isa', which will allow savers to take money out of their Isa and put it back later on in the year without losing any of their tax free entitlement. Mr Osborne said: \u2018We will introduce a radically more Flexible ISA. In two weeks\u2019 time the changes I\u2019ve already made mean people will be able to put \u00a315,240 into an ISA. 'But if you take that money out \u2013 you lose your tax free entitlement, and so can\u2019t put it back in. 'This restricts what people can do with their own savings \u2013 but I believe people should be trusted with their hard earned money. 'With the fully Flexible ISA people will have complete freedom to take money out, and put it back in later in the year, without losing any of their tax-free entitlement . 'It will be available from this autumn and we will also expand the range of investments that are eligible.'",

When doctors told 18-year-old Hannah Tate from Maryville, Tennessee, she was well enough to attend her prom, she took to Instagram to get in touch with hairstylist Tokyo Stylez, who has worked with Rihanna, Naomi Campbell, and Gabrielle Union, in the hopes that he would send her one of his custom-made wigs. But Tokyo took his generosity one step further and secretly began working with Hannah's mother LaVetta Spann in order to personally deliver and style the wig before the Alcoa High School dance.

Unforgettable moment: Hannah Tate, who is battling a rare kidney cancer, posed for a pre-prom photo after a celebrity hairstylist gave her a complete makeover before the high school dance last Saturday .

Unforgettable evening: Hannah tweeted that her prom night was 'epic' Making memories: Hannah and one of her guy friends took a photo together before they entered the dance . 'It took me a second to realize it was him at first, like to actually believe it,' she told WATE.com. Tokyo and his team gave Hannah the star treatment, including make-up and hair styling, before her big night. 'She teared up and cried a little bit. I didn\u2019t want her to because I didn\u2019t want to cry,' Tokyo told the outlet. He added: 'It\u2019s like a once in a lifetime thing. You only go to your senior prom once, so to be a part of it is something that she\u2019ll always remember.'

Nik Simon talks to Warburton and Wales wing legend Shane Williams about the game which could decide the Six Nations Championship. Nik Simon: You'll become Wales's most-capped captain on Saturday. What's the secret? Sam Warburton:\u00a0I take it with a pinch of salt because there are more games now than 30 years ago. Warren Gatland put his faith in me when I was quite young and he's stuck with me. Before I took up the role, some people said 'If someone's out of line, then you have to give it to them'. Rather than the Roy Keane approach, and as a Spurs fan, I like to compare myself to Ledley King. Sportsmail's Nik Simon speaks to Wales captain Sam Warburton and former Test winger Shane Williams . Warburton (left) is set to captain Wales for a record 34th time against Ireland in Cardiff on Saturday . Former Wales and Lions winger Williams believes his Warburton's side are still in the running for the title . Simon: Ryan Jones previously held the record, how do the two compare? Shane Williams: To be captain, you have to be well liked by the players. Warburton came in at the latter stage of my career and was much younger than me, so it was a little strange to have him as captain. But he impressed me straight away and, like Ryan, he trained hard and played hard. Simon: Wales are still in the running for the championship despite losing to England in round one. Are there shades of 2013? Warburton: It's going that way. Our experience in 2013 has given us the belief that we can do it. It was tough then because all the Wales teams previously had won a Grand Slam. Ryan sat us down and gave us the belief that we needed. We've had our one lifeline but we've got the motivation that it's still possible. Williams: Fate is always in your hands with the Six Nations, that's what makes it special. It's an open championship. Ireland are favourites to win in Cardiff but you can't write anyone off \u2014 one result can change everything. Simon: Jonathan Sexton ran the show against England. How much of a threat is he? Warburton: If I'm being honest, I didn't see the game live because I was watching Tottenham v Chelsea in the Capital One Cup final. I flicked back and forth to see the rugby score. But Johnny is a massive part of the Irish team. His attention to detail impressed me on the Lions tour and he knew every move so intricately. He deserves to be known as one of the best players in the world. Ryan Jones (centre) previously held the record for\u00a0Wales's most-capped captain . Simon: How do you defend against Sexton and Conor Murray's kicking game? Williams: The game is changing and there's a massive focus on rugby league style kicks. When I saw the state of Tommy Bowe at the end last week, he had chased a lot of kicks and was very tired. It helps being six-foot plus when you're taking high balls. Dan Biggar is one of the best in the world at kicking the ball in the air, running 40 yards, and catching it. It sounds easy but it's such a big part of the game now. Simon: Who would you select in the Welsh back-three? Williams: Defensively, Leigh Halfpenny is the best full back in the world. George North is my first-choice winger because he's such a talented footballer. On the other wing I would keep Liam Williams, who's the form player in Wales. Scott Baldwin and Luke Charteris were both very good in the pack against France \u2014 especially with the 100 per cent lineout \u2014 and I wouldn't make any changes for the weekend\u2026 if it isn't broken don't fix it! Fly half Jonathan Sexton (right) has been superb for Ireland during this years's tournament . Simon: Can the Welsh half-backs match the Irish? Williams: I've been very impressed with Biggar and Rhys Webb. They've made those positions theirs at the moment and they are able to take pressure off each other through their time management and kicking games. It helps that they've been together at Ospreys and they will have to be on top of their game against Murray and Sexton, because they're the world's in-form combination. Simon: England were blitzed at the breakdown in Dublin, are you putting extra focus on that area? Warburton: Out of all the Six Nations teams I've played against, Ireland have been the most effective at the breakdown. I've not been rewarded as much at the breakdown as I was last year. I haven't made as many turnovers as I would have liked. The post-tackle stuff is always an add-on after training and Shaun Edwards always barks at us when we're doing it. It's key to our game plan. Simon: Ireland have lost just twice in Cardiff in 32 years, why are they so successful? Williams: In the nicest possible way, they take an arrogant approach and expect to win every game. They've had players like Paul O'Connell, Brian O'Driscoll and Ronan O'Gara, who have been able to win these kind of games. They have belief and mental toughness. When they're playing well, they build up confidence and are a very tough team to stop. Wales head coach Warren Gatland (centre) will be pitting his wits against fellow Kiwi Joe Schmidt this week . Simon: What's the key to countering that record? Warburton: Like every international match, there are three areas: set piece, breakdown, kicking game. If you can come out on top in two of those three then that's probably going to be the key. I think the breakdown and the kicking game will be the two key areas against Ireland. We're back at our own little nest in the Vale and we're back at home. After two wins, confidence is high. Simon: Warren Gatland vs Joe Schmidt will be an interesting coaching battle \u2014 how do the two Kiwis compare? Williams: They both stick to the game plan they want to play. Schmidt uses the players as a tool to work out how Ireland are going to play, rather than trying to fit them into a certain game-plan. Warren Gatland is very similar. Warren's got a great way with people. He gets the best out of his players by taking the mick out of them. I used to come off the field and, with a glint in his eye, he would say 'oh you were rubbish today!'. He loves the wind-up and he loves getting his players going. Schmidt is very straight down the line. He says it as it is and gets the best out of his players by being honest. They're different personalities but they're both hugely successful. Wales winger George North makes a strong carry during his side's victory against France in Paris . Simon: Wales are still in the running\u2026 How much of a World Cup confidence boost would it be to win the Six Nations? Warburton: I don't think the Six Nations will have much bearing on the World Cup. In 2011 that wasn't the case. The Six Nations didn't reflect our World Cup campaign. Last year's autumn campaign finished well for us but that didn't transfer into the first game against England. I don't think there's much of a trend with Wales. The most important period will be the three months we're together in the summer. We'll treat that like a pre-season.

        "document": "Gwyneth Paltrow's lifestyle website Goop is handing out quasi-scientific health advice again, this time to pregnant women. According to Ms Paltrow's osteopath - self-described pain expert Vicky Vlachonis, who penned 'ten ways to have a pain-free pregnancy' for Goop - expectant mothers should be careful not to 'relax their vigilance over food', and to always 'remind' themselves: 'You don\u2019t need a ton of food to sustain your baby.' Ms Vlachonis' specific advice about what not to eat while pregnant - 'dairy, rich fatty meats, pork, peanut butter, wheat and sugar, for example' - is very much in keeping with Ms Paltrow's strict diet, so should come as no surprise to dedicated readers of the health-focused website. Scroll down for video . Pseudo-science? Gwyneth Paltrow's (left) osteopath\u00a0Vicky Vlachonis (right) has written a 'ten ways to have a pain-free pregnancy' guide for Goop, in which she encourages a laundry list of food restrictions . Ms Paltrow, who has two children, Apple, ten, and Moses, eight, with estranged husband Chris Martin, has written of Ms Vlachonis in the past: 'As an osteopath, Vicky understands that a pain in the back is rarely just a pain in the back.' But while a number of the tips offered up in the piece \u2013 such as keeping calm and maintaining a healthy diet \u2013 have been welcomed by health experts, Dr. Pat Salber, an internist and the author of popular advice site, TheDoctorWeighsIn.com, tells Daily Mail Online that there is little scientific fact to back up some of Goop\u2019s advice. 'Although not as \"sexy\" as \"anti-inflammatory diets\" and \"magical cures\", common sense approaches to diet and exercise will help you have healthy pregnancy,' she says of the website\u2019s top tips. And when it came to Ms Vlachonic\u2019s suggestion that pregnant women should see grapefruit as a \u2018magical cure\u2019 for morning sickness \u2013 while other foods like wheat, dairy meat and sugar should be avoided at all costs because they increase systemic inflammation \u2013 Dr Salber explained that there is very little evidence to back up any of these claims. 'I am unaware of any science behind this grapefruit recommendation, let alone any evidence to support it,' Dr Salber remarks. 'Most women find that small frequent meals of bland carbohydrates, crackers for example, help with the nausea.' Glowing: In keeping with Ms Paltrow's strict diet, Ms Vlachonic advises expectant moms avoid 'dairy, rich fatty meats, peanut butter, wheat and sugar'. Pictured, Ms Paltrow pregnant with her daughter Apple in 2004 . Ms Vlachonic also makes several references to the impact of the 'pressure' caused by the growing baby on a mother-to-be's back, and warns against lower back massages. 'Pregnant women shouldn't worry about stress on their spine and pelvis because of pregnancy,' counters Dr Salber. 'Remember women's pelvis' evolved to a different shape than men's because we become pregnant.' As for diet, Dr Salber recommends a variety of 'fruits, vegetables, whole grain cereals, and a protein source - whether meat or non-meat'. She does concur with Ms Vlachonis on her advice that pregnant women should 'watch their portion size' however, and recommends 'avoiding fast foods, overly processed foods, and sugared sodas'. One of us: While critics have dubbed her out of touch in recent years, Ms Paltrow, pictured last week in Hong Kong, recently insisted she was 'incredibly close to the common woman' In regards to recommended weight gain, Dr Salber admits: 'There is a great deal of consensus in the medical community about how much weight women should gain during pregnancy. 'It depends on whether you are normal, over, or underweight to start with.' 'Normal weight women should gain between 25-35 pounds, underweight women between 28 to 40 pounds, and overweight between 15-25 pounds. Obese women should gain slightly less, between 11-20 pounds. Other kernels of advice offered up by Ms Vlachonic in her recent Goop post include getting 12 to 14 hours of sleep a day, and plenty of time spent in the 'bathtub, a pool, or the sea.' She even helpfully suggests: 'The crowd that hangs out at the pool tend to be so kind and sweet when you\u2019re pregnant!' Repeat offender: Goop (pictured) often comes under fire for handing out questionable health advice, not to mention outrageously expensive products . This is far from the first time Goop has been criticized for its questionable health advice. In January, Ms Paltrow came under fire for suggesting women partake in 'vaginal steams', which she said 'cleanse your uterus' and 'balance female hormone levels'. This information was slammed by doctors, some who even suggested the practice might be harmful. Just this week, Ms Paltrow defended herself in the face of long-standing criticism surrounding Goop's expensive and unattainable content. Speaking to CNN Money, she said: 'I'm incredibly close to the common woman in that I'm a woman and I'm a mother and we all are in a physical body with beating hearts with compassion and love we are all seekers. 'We all want fulfillment, we all want to live our best lives. We want to be healthy and happy and squeeze the most we can out of life. I think that's all women.'",

More than 33,000 shoppers have signed up on Facebook to participate in the giant maze-like store in Tempe, inner west of Sydney on Saturday, May 23. The event will begin from 1pm and within 10 minutes from the starting time, players are encouraged to hide in wardrobes, storage units and underneath piles of soft toys. But the Swedish retailer has put a stop to the unofficial event after attracting tens of thousands of participants, claiming the game 'raises security issues for both customers and co-workers.' Furniture giant IKEA has banned people from playing one of the most-loved childhood games - hide and seek . More than 33,000 shoppers have signed up on Facebook to participate in the giant maze-like at a Sydney store . 'As many of you may have heard, there are a couple of large hide-and-seek games being planned for IKEA stores in Australia,' IKEA said in a statement. 'While the prospect of seeing many of you trying to camouflage yourselves among the meatballs has its appeal, we are unfortunately unable to host or support these games. 'Due to the level of interest these games attract we would not be able to guarantee everyone\u2019s safety and the threat this poses to our co-workers, customers and game participants is just too great. We would still love to have you visit \u2013 no need to hide!' But the Swedish retailer has put a stop to the unofficial event after attracting tens of thousands of participants . However, the organisers of the event have set out  rules ahead of the game, with each player expected to pay an entry fee of one dollar. The last person left unfound will walk away with the prize pool money but in an event, if all players are discovered, the money will be donated to a charitable cause, the organisers claim. Other rules include restrictions to hiding such as 'do not hide in fire escapes' and 'do not hide in toilets.' The ban comes after Amsterdam IKEA in Eindhoven were forced to cancel the bizarrely popular event . Hundreds have expressed their interests, with many saying they will travel from interstate to take part in the giant hide and seek event. The ban comes just a week after Amsterdam IKEA in Eindhoven were forced to cancel the bizarrely popular event citing safety concerns. The idea of using an Ikea store for an adult game of hide and seek has been mooted for years, given the furniture stores' abundance of adult-sized hiding places.",

        "document": "(CNN)When American writer Avijit Roy was hacked to death on a Dhaka, Bangladesh, street in full view of horrified onlookers, blogger Washiqur Rahman doubled down. Fundamentalists were choking free thought in his secular nation, he wrote. But they couldn't silence it. His friends warned him to be careful, to watch what he posted online. But Rahman dismissed those concerns, saying his Facebook profile page didn't even bear his picture. They don't even know what I look like, he told them. On Monday, the 27-year-old Rahman fell victim to the same brazen act that killed Roy, hacked to death by two men with knives and meat cleavers just outside his house as he headed to work at a travel agency. He was so maimed -- with wounds to his head, face and neck -- that police identified him through the voter identification card he was carrying. His death was the second time in five weeks that someone was killed in Dhaka for online posts critical of Islam -- but they are hardly the only two who've paid a steep price. In the last two years, several  bloggers have died, either murdered or under mysterious circumstances. \"The despicable murder of Avijit Roy last month should have led authorities to step up protection measures for bloggers and others at risk. The killing of Washiqur Rahman today is another clear example of the Bangladeshi government's utter failure to ensure the safety of those at risk,\" said Abbas Faiz of  Amnesty International. \"How many more bloggers will have to be attacked before action is taken?\" As shocking as Rahman's death was, the reaction from some quarters was equally disturbing. On his Facebook page (for which he picked a custom URL that translates to \"unbeliever\"), Rahman had posted a picture with the hashtag #IamAvijit. After his death, someone left a comment, \"Now you are.\" Another wrote, \"I felt sorry when I first learned of your death. But then I saw what you wrote and I am not.\" On his page, Rahman reposted a cartoon depicting Prophet Mohammed from the French satire magazine Charlie Hebdo. He wished a happy birthday to author Taslima Nasreen, who was forced to flee Bangladesh due to death threats from fundamentalists. And he \"liked\" a picture of sausages wrapped in crescent rolls that someone had captioned, \"Pigs in burqas.\" Posts threatening him were numerous. \"Get ready for the afterlife,\" one person commented on one of his posts. \"See you in hell,\" said another. He used to write under the pseudonym \"Stupid Man\" on a blog but switched to posting on Facebook after 2011. On Facebook, he is credited for a series, \"Jaw-crushing answers to insulting comments of atheists.\" There, he posted questions that critics of Islam often raised and then answered them. But he paired the answers in such a way that they highlighted the contradiction within Islam. For example, one question asked what proof was there that the Quran was the word of God. The answer, \"Mohammed said in his own words that the Quran is the word of God. Since Mohammed is the messenger of Allah, his claims are true.\" He placed the question next to one that asked, \"What is the proof that Mohammed was the messenger of Allah?\" The answer, \"The Quran claims that Mohammed was the messenger of Allah. And since the Quran is God's word, its claims must be true.\" Asif Mohiuddin, a blogger who himself was wounded by machete-wielding attackers in 2013 but survived, remembered Rahman as a great satirist. \"I named him the George Carlin of Bangladesh,\" he told the International Humanist and Ethical Union. \"He wanted with all his heart, a true secular country, where everyone can practice their freedom.\" The irony is that the people who killed Rahman weren't even familiar with his writings; they were simply following orders, police said. Of the three involved in the Monday morning attack, two were quickly caught by bystanders. In confessions to police, the pair -- both students at Islamic schools -- said they didn't know what a blog was, nor had they seen Rahman's writing. They said they were acting on orders from another person who told them killing Rahman was a religious duty, Police Commissioner Biplob Kumar Sarkar told reporters. The third person is still to be apprehended. That appears to be par for the course in the killings of bloggers in Bangladesh. The only person arrested in the killing of Roy, the U.S. blogger, is Farabi Shafiur Rahman, who had called for his death in Facebook posts. There has been no conviction in the January 2013 attack on Mohiuddin. And no convictions in yet another case -- the hacking death of blogger Ahmed Rajib Haider, also in 2013. \"The Bangladeshi government must urgently establish accountability in this murder case and others,\" the Committee to Project Journalists said after Rahman's death. \"Otherwise the rest of the country's bloggers, commentators and journalists covering sensitive topics remain at grave risk of being attacked as well.\" Bloggers, unlike political parties, aren't an organized force -- and that makes them an easy target for radicals, said Imran Sarker, who heads the Blogger and Online Activists Network in Bangladesh. \"They want peace, they talk of humanity. If you strike them with stones, they don't strike back. They try to reach you with flowers,\" he said. \"So, if you want to sow fear and stifle progressive thought, they are easy to pick on.\" But the deaths -- of Rahman, of Roy, of Haider -- have emboldened the movement, rather than chill them into silence. \"No one is cowering in their homes because this is happening. Because this has been happening regularly for a long time,\" he said. \"We want to take the society forward. We know we have a lot left to accomplish.\" CNN's Omar Khan, Kunal Sehgal and Ravi Agrawal contributed to this report.",

        "document": "(CNN)It was a ding, just a \"minor concussion,\" that got Chris Borland thinking that playing football might not be worth the millions that come with being an NFL player. Borland was a rookie linebacker in his first training camp in August when he got his \"bell rung,\" he told ESPN's \"Outside The Lines.\" What did he do? He kept playing that day, and through an excellent rookie season. But the thought of the permanent damage that might be happening to him kept nagging at him. He talked to his teammates and family, read about concussions and their effects, each day coming closer to the decision that he finally announced this week. At age 24, not even yet in his prime as an NFL player, Borland told his team he was retiring because he was worried about the long-term effects of head trauma. \"I just honestly want to do what's best for my health,\" he told ESPN. \"From what I've researched and what I've experienced, I don't think it's worth the risk. ... I'm concerned that if you wait (until) you have symptoms, it's too late.\" It was after that self-described \"minor concussion\" in the preseason that Borland threw himself into researching what had happened to other football players. In the end he didn't want to leave his teammates in a bind, but, \"I know this is right for me.\" He said teammates' reactions to his retirement were mixed. One of his best friends told him that he was crazy to walk away from the money. Borland, a third-round pick from Wisconsin, had signed a nearly $3 million contract for four seasons with the San Francisco 49ers and banked a $600,000 bonus. The guys who wanted him to come back would say to the 49ers top tackler, \"That's a lot of money. Why don't you get your money and get out,\" Borland recounted to ESPN. The thought made him uncomfortable because he doesn't want to do anything just for a big paycheck. He didn't want to be wrong when it comes to this: \"Who knows how many hits are too many?\" Borland is one of a handful of players to retire young but possibly the first to retire before concussions became an issue for him. He's also now part of a shift in thinking about what repeated head injuries can do to an athlete. Reports show an increasing number of retired NFL players who have suffered concussions developed memory and cognitive issues such as dementia, Alzheimer's disease, depression and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE. \"For me, it's wanting to be proactive,\" Borland said. \"I'm concerned that if you wait (until) you have symptoms, it's too late. There are a lot of unknowns. I can't claim that 'X' will happen. \"I just want to live a long, healthy life, and I don't want to have any neurological diseases or die younger than I would otherwise.\" Passionate reactions to his decision came quickly, with many supporting him. Others say that while the move might be smart for Borland, and even encourage other players to speak out and stand up for their health, there will always be plenty of guys eager to replace players like him. Borland told ESPN that he wasn't saying no one should play football. He said youth players and their parents should do things: 1) Get informed about concussions and 2) Never let anyone play . Last August, thousands of former NFL players and their families reached a deal in a class-action suit that called for the NFL to cover the cost of concussion-related compensation, medical exams and medical research for retired players and their families. The suit alleged that the NFL deliberately misled players about scientific data that the medical community had found about the risks associated with concussions.  In July 2014, a federal judge granted preliminary approval to the landmark deal but she has yet to give final approval to the settlement. Chris Dronett was one of the plaintiffs. Her husband, former Denver Bronco Shane Dronett, committed suicide in 2009 when he was 38. After his death, scientists found evidence of CTE in his brain. Borland named three players he said made him rethink a life in the NFL. \"I've thought about what I could accomplish in football, but for me personally, when you read about Mike Webster and Dave Duerson and Ray Easterling, you read all these stories. And to be the type of player I want to be in football, I think I'd have to take on some risks that as a person I don't want to take on,\" he said. Webster had a career with the Pittsburgh Steelers and Kansas City Chiefs from 1974 to 1990. He was the first former NFL player to be diagnosed with CTE. After he retired, he was diagnosed with amnesia, dementia, depression, and bone and muscle pain. He was 50 when he died. Duerson killed himself with a gunshot to the chest. He had sent a text to his family asking that his brain be sent to Boston University School of Medicine, which was researching CTE. BU neurologists confirmed the NFL veteran had the disease. Easterling, who played eight seasons with the Atlanta Falcons, committed suicide in 2012. He apparently suffered dementia. An autopsy revealed he had CTE. Some on social media said Borland's decision made them think about former NFL linebacker Junior Seau. He was 43 when he was found dead with a gunshot wound to the chest. Friends and family members say multiple concussions were to blame for the suicide, but an initial autopsy report found no apparent brain damage. Portions of Seau's brain were sent to the National Institutes of Health, which found \"abnormalities ... that are consistent with a form\" of CTE. He will be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame this summer. The NFL has reported that in 2013, 228 concussions were diagnosed from practices and games. At least 261 were diagnosed the previous year, the league said. In its statement about Borland's retirement, Jeff Miller, the NFL's senior vice president for health and safety, said: \"We respect Chris Borland's decision and wish him all the best. Playing any sport is a personal decision. By any measure, football has never been safer and we continue to make progress with rule changes, safer tackling techniques at all levels of football, and better equipment, protocols and medical care for players.\" Miller added that the league understands there is more work to do to improve player safety. Complaints keep coming. In July of last year, ex-NFL players Christian Ballard and Gregory Westbrooks filed suit against the NFL Players Association, alleging the union withheld information about head injuries. Opinion: Why are these NFLers retiring early? CNN's Jill Martin contributed to this report.",

        "document": "Mike Zimmer says the Minnesota Vikings have no intention of trading Adrian Peterson. But the player and his agent have other ideas. 'We're planning on him being back. We have no plans to trade Adrian,' he said. 'We're good to go. I mean, he's under contract and we expect him to honor it,' Zimmer said at the NFL Annual Meeting. 'I think when he goes into the Hall of Fame, he's going to want to go in with the jersey that everyone remembers him as. That will be as a Viking.' Adrian Peterson played one game for the Vikings last season before being suspended . But Ben Dogra, agent of the superstar running back, has other ideas. 'Adrian and I feel it is in his best interest, and it would be his desire, to play elsewhere in the NFL. This is not personal in any way, it is business,' he told the Associated Press. Three years remain on the 30-year-old's deal with $12.75million due this season. None of the money is guaranteed. Peterson remains on the Commissioners Exempt List until at least April 15 after hitting his four-year-old son with a switch and the 2012 MVP has been less than enthusiastic about returning to Minnesota. Zimmer also poured scorn on notions that the Vikings are set to trade 2013 first round draft pick Cordarrelle Patterson. Mike Zimmer spoke to reporters during the NFL's annual meeting in Phoenix .

        "document": "Kris Boyd has insisted that even Jose Mourinho himself would have struggled to change Rangers\u2019 fortunes if he were in charge at Ibrox. After their dismal 1-1 draw at home to Livingston on Saturday, the Govan club languish in third position in the Championship table \u2013 24 points behind runaway leaders Hearts \u2013 and face an uphill task if they are to secure promotion via the end-of-season play-offs. However, Boyd believes that with the club now on its third manager of a farcical season, the time has come for all those on the playing staff to give themselves a brutal reality check \u2013 before they end up costing yet another man his job. Manager Stuart McCall puts Rangers, third in the Championship, through their paces in training . Boyd said it would not matter if Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho (pictured) was in charge at Ibrox . \u2018We\u2019re now on our third manager and it gets to the stage where you have to ask questions of the players,\u2019 said Boyd, ahead of Rangers\u2019 league meeting with Alloa on Tuesday night at Ibrox. \u2018It doesn\u2019t matter if you were to go and bring in Jose Mourinho \u2013 he would still have the same players to deal with. \u2018Sometimes it can help when a new manager arrives and is looking at it from a different angle - a fresh eye. But, ultimately, it\u2019s the same players going out on the pitch and if we\u2019re being brutally honest, it\u2019s us who need to get a grip. \u2018We can sit and say we\u2019ve got international players in the dressing room but, at the end of the day, we haven\u2019t performed and two managers have lost their job because of that, so we need to start winning games of football. \u2018It can\u2019t be all the manager\u2019s fault. That\u2019s why we need to look ourselves in the mirror and ask if we\u2019ve done enough. I can safely say that I don\u2019t feel as if I have. And I\u2019m willing to bet the majority - if not all the players - would say the same thing. Kris Boyd in action for Rangers in their 1-1 draw with Livingston on Saturday . \u2018We have a period now until the end of the season where everyone on the playing staff needs to get a grip. You can blame all different aspects - but it\u2019s only excuses. We haven\u2019t performed on the pitch and that\u2019s the bottom line.\u2019 After admitting recently that his second spell at Ibrox had been a failure on a personal level, with only three league goals to his name, Boyd has certainly not tried to shy away from the grim reality surrounding the club. And he believes that due to their current malaise, the fear factor has now well and truly gone for any team visiting Ibrox. He added: \u2018I\u2019ve been in the situation myself when you turn up at Ibrox or Parkhead and you\u2019re already beaten. They might have won 4-0 or 5-0 the week before and you look around you and think: \u201cOh no\u201d. \u2018But that\u2019s not the case any more. Teams are coming with confidence and have seen that we\u2019ve been weak. Previously, it was only European teams who didn\u2019t change their game for Rangers - but teams now aren\u2019t worrying about us. \u2018Livingston came at the weekend and got the ball down and passed it crisply. They deserved their point. They might have lost five games previously, but they probably looked at us as being weak and tried to get in our faces.\u2019",

        "document": "Man who would be President: Texas Senator Ted Cruz will reportedly announce his bid on Monday . Ted Cruz will reportedly announce his intention to run for President of the United States this Monday, which would make him the first officially declared hopeful in the 2016 election. The Texas Republican senator, who is still in his first term of Congress, is due to commit himself to a presidential campaign at a speech in Virginia next week, according to senior advisers. Aides in the Cruz camp spoke about his intentions to the Houston Chronicle, but insisted on remaining anonymous. Cruz will hope to triumph against other GOP front-runners such as Jeb Bush, Scott Walker and Rand Paul to win his party's nomination. The Chronicle reported that Cruz will announce at a convocation ceremony held at Liberty University, Virginia, the world's largest Christian university. Sketching out his campaign strategy, Cruz aides said he will hope to raise more than $40million to help him compete in the primary campaign. Cruz is said to be skipping the step of forming an 'exploratory committee', which Jeb Bush has already taken, and will directly announce the bid. He will hope that his conservative credentials will play well with the Tea Party wing of the GOP, and also rely on scooping up second and third-preference votes from less convinced voters. Though he lacks the clout of other candidates within Washington and the political establishment, strategists admit, they hope that with the voters of key states like Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, he will be able to carry the day nonetheless. However, Cruz remains an outlier in a busy Republican field. A poll earlier this month, from Quinnipiac University, gave him 6 per cent of the GOP vote. Men to beat: Jeb Bush, left, and Scott Walker, right, both command more GOP support than Cruz. Bush has formed an 'exploratory committee' for his bid, while Walker has yet to announce . In comparison, Wisconsin governor Scott Walker took 18 per cent, former Florida governor Jeb Bush won 16, with three other hopefuls still polling better than Cruz. However wins the Republican nomination will still have to win out against the Democratic contender, most likely Hillary Clinton, to take the White House next year. Nobody else has outright declared an intention to run yet. However, MSNBC\u00a0reported last week that Rand Paul is planning to announce on April 7. The Kentucky senator will reportedly make the direct announcement is Louisville, which would give Cruz a two-week head start.",

        "document": "A young woman, who had no luck when she posted an ad on Gumtree to find the\u00a0father of her unborn son, is determined to keep searching after her baby almost died at birth. Bianca Fazey had a one-night stand with a man in Perth, Western Australia on April 23 last year and surprisingly discovered she was pregnant after being told in 2011 that she was unlikely to ever become a mum when she was diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome. The 25-year-old frantically searched for the father for five months but had no success as she only knew his name was Jeremy who was from the Perth suburb of Morley. As a last-ditch attempt she decided to post the ad which only created unexpected vitriolic responses from total strangers. Two months ago, Logan Fazey was born, but he did not have an easy start to life when doctors worked for 30 minutes to resuscitate him but now the little fella is fighting fit and healthy. Now that life has returned to normal after the trauma, the graphic design student has continued to look for Logan's father, a fly-in, fly-out worker in his 20s, who she met at the Harlem Wednesdays night at Amplifier Capitol. Scroll down for video . Bianca Fazey continues to \u00a0search for Logan's father who she had a one-night stand with in April last year . Two months ago, Logan was born, but he did not have an easy start to life when doctors worked for 30 minutes to resuscitate him - pictured is the first time Bianca got to touch her son . Now the little fella is fighting fit and Bianca described Logan as 'strong, smart, happy and very, very loved' Her latest appeal has seen social media users label Bianca as an unfit mother and accuse her of telling her story just for the money. 'I'm so appalled at comments that I am a bad mother and 'god help my child'. It makes me sick that people can judge so quickly off something that is 500 words long,' she said on her Facebook page. 'Yeah I am still looking, I will probably always be looking I am very curious as to who this person is and one day Logan probably will be too. 'I don't ever expect him to come forward but if he did contact me, it would only be between us two and not the world. ' Bianca then responded to the accusations that she was paid to do the media interviews. 'For the incredibly judgemental people thinking it is all about money, I have never accepted anything for the stories, I also have my own money, I work and I study full time, I am not this drop kick you assume me to be!' she said. 'I love this beautiful boy with all my heart and I am a fantastic mother, he is strong, smart, happy and very, very loved!' She then went onto express her gratitude for the ongoing support of her family and friends in the town of Jurien Bay - 260km north of Perth. 'Not only do I have the support of my family but also this beautiful town I live in and my amazing friends, I am so appreciative of everyone who has been kind to me even if you are holding your tongue!' she said. 'I don't know if this will be the end of this story, I will continue living my life and raising Logan just as I have been, in no way is getting 15 minutes of fame a priority on my list. 'Logan, my family, our health and happiness is all that matters to me.' Bianca Fazey posted a Gumtree ad last year in an attempt to find her unborn son's father . Bianca's ad (pictured) received a barrage of hateful remarks from complete strangers . When Bianca fell pregnant all she could think about was letting the pending father know the news. 'I was at my wits end,' she told Daily Mail Australia in December. 'I tried finding him for months and felt pressured by a friend who was adamant I don't give up despite exhausting all avenues.' This when Bianca, who was so stressed that she was losing sleep, decided to post an ad on Gumtree which created a barrage of hateful responses prompting her to take to take it down. 'I stupidly put it up thinking no one would even see it but who knows what will happen, maybe I will get lucky,' she said. 'Unfortunately all I got was lots of judgement and idiots messaging me telling me they would be the father or pretending to be Jeremy.' The most offensive messages were from people saying that Bianca should have opted for a termination. 'When it was shared on the LAD bible page a lot of people made single-minded comments aimed at me, no one mentioned the guy was equally a part of me getting pregnant,' she said. 'Sometimes I want to be like one of those people on Maury Povich screaming back at the audience because they have no clue what they're booing about!' Bianca was forced to take down the post but has no regrets about deciding to have the baby . Bianca (pictured before being pregnant) never thought she could have children as she suffers from\u00a0polycystic ovary syndrome . Bianca wasn't exactly shocked to be called names like a 'sl**' but it got out of control when one person lashed out saying 'kill it'. 'It was sad to see people saying I should get an abortion, those were the only comments that hurt.' 'Society is still hating on women who choose to keep pregnancy outside of a relationship,' she said. 'I was more mad at the amount of women (mums included) saying I shouldn't go through with it.' But Bianca has risen above the horrendous backlash and can't wait to meet her little man when he enters the world in two months. 'All I can say is I chose to go ahead with the pregnancy because I didn't think I could have children,' she said. 'Even though I knew this guy had disappeared I didn't want to give up my chance and I'm so grateful I didn't.' Bianca has hit out at people saying she is a 'sl**', a bad mother and has only told her story for money . Despite the fall-out from the ad - Bianca has the loving support of the people who matter most - her family and friends. 'It has changed my life and made me a happier healthier person,' she said. 'I couldn't be happier, I am looking forward to holding my little guy and raising him in a loving stable environment.' She is also looking forward to getting back into shape . 'Excited to hold him and excited to start getting back in shape!' she said. 'I hate that I'm so limited physically.' Bianca still hopes the father will come forward and become an integral part of his son's life. 'I do hope that I can find him and let him know, he can make his own choice,' she said. 'But more for the sake of the kid, when he asks questions or wants to find him I want to be prepared.' She still hopes the father will come forward and become an integral part of Logan's life .",

        "document": "Disgraced MP Eric Joyce used his\u00a0taxpayer-funded credit to pay for  \u00a3450-a-night hotels during his \u00a313,000 expenses binge, it has been revealed. The ex-Labour backbencher, who is standing down at the next election after he was convicted of headbutting a Tory MP in a Commons bar, repeatedly used his Parliamentary card to settle big bills. Many of these payments were later declared unclaimable on expenses, but his card was not blocked by the\u00a0Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) for more than two years. He even claimed that one \u00a3896.92 bill for two nights was for a 'whole bunch of people' to stay at the four-star Park Plaza near Westminster. Disgraced MP Eric Joyce used his taxpayer-funded credit to pay for \u00a3450-a-night hotels during his \u00a313,000 expenses binge . Mail Online's  Tom McTague revealed earlier this week that\u00a0Commons expenses chiefs made the unprecedented decision to recoup the cash by deducting around \u00a31,000 a month from his salary. But that will not clear the outstanding sum of around \u00a310,000 before Parliament is dissolved. The Falkirk MP accepts that he made mistakes in filing claims after using his card, suggesting he was also paying for rooms for staff. However, he is disputing at least \u00a36,000 of the debt. If he refuses to repay voluntarily the watchdog's only option will be to pursue him in the civil courts. The details emerged after Ipsa admitted it has been labelling some of Mr Joyce's hotel claims as 'not paid' in its regular disclosures - when in fact it has paid a much higher bill in full. The Falkirk MP accepts that he made mistakes in filing claims after using his card, suggesting he was also paying for rooms for staff . The watchdog confirmed he put \u00a3743 on a card to fund a three night-stay at a 'non-London' hotel, believed to be in Glasgow, in September last year. The bill was automatically paid by Ipsa. But as he is only entitled to claim up to \u00a3120 a night for hotels outside the capital, an excess of \u00a3383 was added to his debt. The published expenses records merely state that \u00a3383 was 'not paid'. He was was 'not paid' \u00a3272.33 for a non-London hotel claim in August, and \u00a3208 for another in September. Mr Joyce stayed at a prestigious Intercontinental Hotel in London in May 2013, when he appears to have broken the \u00a3150 a night limit for hotels in the capital by \u00a3203.05. He used the same group again the following month, but this time breached the ceiling by just \u00a361.45. The issues seem to go back to at least 2012. In December of that year - 10 months after he headbutted a Tory MP during a brawl in a Commons bar - he charged \u00a3896.92 to the card for a two-night stay at a London hotel. It is understood that the claim was declared invalid because key parts of the receipt had been blacked out - although again Ipsa had already footed the cost and subsequently reported it as 'not paid'. Altogether there are dozens of hotel claims listed as either 'not paid' or 'part paid' since 2012, totalling some \u00a34,000. Mr Joyce insisted he was using hotels booked through the parliamentary travel office, and said some bills were high because staff stayed at the same time. The \u00a3896.92 bill was for a 'whole bunch of people' to stay at the Park Plaza near Westminster, he said. 'That was all of my staff in London,' he said. 'That was essentially an error. It should have come off my (personal) card. 'They would have all been eligible (for expenses) but the parliamentary card was used rather than their cards or my card.' Mr Joyce said Ipsa had contacted him about spending in late 2013, but he heard nothing else and believed they had dropped the matter until last December. He even claimed that one \u00a3896.92 bill for two nights was for a 'whole bunch of people' to stay at the four-star Park Plaza near Westminster (pictured) 'The whole figure was only exposed in December,' he said. 'Some of these figures are legitimate debts to Ipsa but they would not discuss the rest of it.' Mr Joyce said there was a 'particular issue' with a member of staff who moved to Brighton from Scotland. He said the watchdog had signed off an arrangement where the employee worked from home but occasionally stayed at hotels in London. However, after 16 months, Ipsa decided the claims were invalid and demanded the money back, according to Mr Joyce. The MP said he had asked the watchdog's compliance officer to look again at the situation. An Ipsa spokesman said: 'MPs have a responsibility to manage their financial affairs and we publish details of all of their claims - both paid and not. 'We have consistently told the MP that he has a budget to keep to and that he is liable for any excess. We have stressed this time and again throughout the Parliament, as we do to every MP. 'We've been talking to the MP since autumn 2013 to put his financial affairs on an even keel. As you would expect, when this didn't work we escalated these conversations within Ipsa and this approach resulted in a personal assurance from the MP that he would repay the amounts due. Mr Joyce stayed at a prestigious Intercontinental Hotel in London in May 2013, when he appears to have broken the \u00a3150 a night limit for hotels in the capital by \u00a3203.05 . 'When those assurances were not followed through, we turned off his payment card in January 2015 and in February 2015 we moved to recovering money directly from his salary. We will continue to recover this money until it is repaid in full. 'This is a very unusual case. We've tried to encourage the MP to manage this situation. Clearly, this hasn't worked and we are committed to getting this money back. That is why have moved to more direct measures of recovery, including taking money straight from his pay packet.' In 2008, before Ipsa took over the system, Mr Joyce had his parliamentary expenses suspended after putting nearly \u00a35,000 in 'non-parliamentary' travel expenses to Tokyo, Kinshasa and Nairobi on a Commons card, and then ignoring repeated demands from officials to repay. The latest situation could fuel calls for Ipsa to publish fuller, receipt-level information about MPs' spending. The watchdog has already lost two rounds of an Freedom of Information battle to avoid publishing copies of every receipt filed, a process that could potentially cost millions of pounds. The Court of Appeal is due to hear the case later this month - but no judgement is expected until after the election. In March 2013 the former Army major was banned from buying alcohol in Parliament following another bust-up. He was fined \u00a31,500 for abusive language towards a baggage handler at Edinburgh Airport earlier this year. Mr Joyce has refused to resign his seat despite pressure from critics.

        "document": "When Cristiano Ronaldo started the year with a Ballon d'Or award nobody thought 2015 could ever turn into his annus horribilis. But since his 'Siiii!' war cry in Zurich when he collected the trophy and sent an 'I'm coming for you' message to Lionel Messi, the Real Madrid forward's fortunes have been in free-fall to the extent that the exit door that leads back to Manchester United has been opened once again. Ronaldo's agent Jorge Mendes told Spanish radio his player would go on scoring goals for Real Madrid until he is 40 as the club and the player's entourage celebrated his well-deserved gong in January. Real Madrid forward Cristiano Ronaldo sits on the Bernabeu pitch during his side's 2-0 win against Levante . The former Manchester United man endured a frustrating evening despite his side's La Liga victory . Ronaldo has a shot at goal on Sunday night but he was unable to find the back of the net . But since then he has been sent off and banned for two games; chastised by supporters for holding a birthday party through the early hours after a humiliating derby day defeat by Atletico Madrid and pledged a vow of silence after the team's defeat in the Champions League to Schalke. Manchester United have been linked with both a bold move for Gareth Bale or a romantic return for Ronaldo. Sources in Madrid now say of the two moves, it would be a bid for Ronaldo that would meet with less resistance. For all the boos and whistles for Gareth Bale from sections of the Santiago Bernabeu crowd the club president Florentino Perez is firmly behind his \u00a386million signing and sees him as Ronaldo's heir apparent. Ronaldo is even understood to have done more to help the former Tottenham forward as he tries to push his profile and get himself on next year's Ballon d'Or podium. The request was not received with open arms. Much like Bale when he scored twice on Sunday against Levante. Gareth Bale celebrates after opening the scoring but Ronaldo appeared frustrated that he hadn't found the net . Ronaldo celebrates winning the Premier League title with Manchester United shortly before leaving in 2009 . A return to Old Trafford is not out of the question for the Portuguese superstar after a miserable start to 2015 . Real Madrid trio Ronaldo, Bale and Karim Benzema share an embrace after the Welshman's second goal . Bale, pictured with his partner Emma Rhys-Jones, is seen as the heir to Ronaldo by Florentino Perez . Ronaldo failed to celebrate his team-mate's opening goal because he was too busy lamenting his own misfortune at not scoring after failing to connect properly with a scissor kick from the edge of the six-yard area. Like the incredible sulk of old, Ronaldo could be seen throwing his arms up in the air both before and after Bale converted the rebound. Gary Lineker tweeted: 'Ronaldo's extraordinarily stroppy reaction to Bale scoring from a rebound from his effort was bizarre and unhealthy.' He was also frustrated when Bale scored his second goal getting the slightest of touches on a Ronaldo shot but enough to divert it past the Levante goalkeeper to wrap up the three points. And with those two goals for Bale and a string of misses from himself in what remained of the game, including one sitter in injury-time and a weak shot from a perfect Bale cross in the first half, Ronaldo went straight down the tunnel at full-time, not to the centre circle to applaud supporters. Ronaldo split up with his long-term girlfriend, Russian model and actress Irina Shayk, in January . Ronaldo's form has dipped since his split and Lionel Messi now has more goals than him this season . Irina accompanied Ronaldo to the FIFA Ballon d'Or awards in January 2014 but she was absent this year . Off the pitch things have gone no better for him with a split from Russian girlfriend Irina Shayk ensuring he has filled the pages of many of Spain's gossip magazines amid speculation about why the couple broke up and who his next partner will be. All this with the Clasico on the horizon \u2013 a match he would never have dreamed he would go in to on fewer goals than Messi who now has two more than his rival. Last year Ronaldo raced to a 12-goal lead over Messi who was struggling for form and fell out spectacularly with his manager Luis Enrique. Messi's relationship with his coach is now on the mend and he has scored 20 goals since the start of the year. Things change so quickly in Spanish football and Ronaldo's last three months are evidence of that. What also may have changed is the possibility that after six extraordinary seasons at the Bernabeu Ronaldo could yet find time in his record-breaking career to go back to Old Trafford for a glorious swansong.

The doodles show a ballerina twirling in a music box and another depicts a girl drinking tea and surrounded by flowers while sat in an armchair.

Sexist doodles: The popular Chinese website has been accused of missing the point of International Women's Day with ballerina image . The depictions caused outrage on social media as websites celebrated International Women's Day on Sunday. Video-sharing site Youku, wished female users: 'May the world treat you gently.' Critics wasted no time in comparing the two websites to global giant Google which featured women in professions, including an astronaut,\u00a0a scientist, sports players an artist, a chef and a musician. Weibo user @Zoexiaoyizi, said of the ballerina: \u00a0'This is how you define women and celebrate them! On the mark: By contrast, Google's doodle shows images of female scientists, astronauts, judges and sports stars to illustrate achievements . Chinese authorities detained several women right's activists this weekend. Some had planned to hold a nationwide protest against sexual harassment.On Monday, five were still being held police, said an activist and a friend of the women, who asked not to be identified. Beijing traditionally cracks down on activists during important meetings like this week's National People's Congress (NPC). 'Google's doodle just makes their stupidity even worse.' Guo Weiqing, a professor at Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou, told CNN, that the\u00a0imagery suggested that women are there only to be taken care of and look pretty while the business of the real world is left to men.

        "document": "A new biography makes the startling claim that\u00a0Walt Disney CEO Bob Iger purposely kept Steve Jobs' cancer a secret despite learning that he was very sick hours before his company bought the animation studio. Iger learned that Job's cancer had returned half an hour before Disney announced it was buying Jobs' Pixar studio in 2006. But in an extraordinary show of faith the CEO of Disney decided to keep the Apple co-founder's condition a secret for three years, according to a new biography of Jobs obtained by\u00a0Bloomberg. Secret pact: Steve Jobs, right, talks with Walt Disney Company CEO Bob Iger at an Apple media event in 2006, a new book\u00a0makes the startling claim that  Iger purposely kept Jobs' cancer a secret despite learning that he was very sick hours before buying Jobs' Pixar . Confession: On the day of the deal in 2006, the pair found a secluded spot on the Pixar campus in Emeryville, California, pictured, where Jobs put his arm around Iger's shoulder and revealed that his cancer was back . In the book titled 'Becoming Steve Jobs' by Brent Schlender and Rick Tetzeli, due to be published on March 24, details emerged of the business pact that made\u00a0Jobs' Disney's largest shareholder. Iger reasoned that Disney's $7 billion deal for Pixar was not about Jobs or his medical condition so it did not need to be disclosed, according to the biography. The book details how Iger told Jobs: 'You're our largest shareholder, but I don't think that makes this matter. You're not material to this deal. We're buying Pixar, we're not buying you.' Jobs, the prolific co-founder of Apple, was first diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2003. He underwent surgery to remove it in 2004, but the tumor returned and he had a liver transplant in 2009. The book details how on\u00a0January 24, 2006, the proposed day of the deal, Iger was at Pixar's headquarters for the ceremony when Jobs asked to go for a private walk. As the pair found a secluded spot on the campus in Emeryville, California, Jobs put his arm around Iger's shoulder and revealed that his cancer was back. Secret: Iger, right, reasoned that the $7 billion deal was on the value of Pixar, not Jobs, left, or his medical condition, so, after consulting a lawyer, the deal went ahead . Pixar deal: Steve Jobs, famous founder of Apple Computer, sits beneath the symbol of another of his ventures, Pixar Animation Studios, on\u00a0January 24, 2006, Disney bought the firm for $7 million, despite Job's cancer . Marriage: Steve Jobs and his wife, Laurene Powell, are pictured at the Pixar Exhibit Launch 2005. The couple married in 1991, and she, along with his doctor, were the only ones who knew  he had cancer at first . Pixar: Ralph J. Guggenheim (right), an executive at Pixar Animation Studios, talks with an animator in the office. The firm has become a powerhouse animation studio for Disney, responsible for producing hits like Toy Story . Iger said Job's confided: 'Frankly, they tell me I've got a 50-50 chance of living five years.' Iger added: 'So I look at my watch and we've got 30 minutes. In 30 minutes, we're going to make this announcement. We've got television crews, we've got the board votes, we've got investment bankers. Pixar is an American computer animation film studio based in Emeryville, California. It is best known for its CGI-animated feature films and has produced fourteen feature films, beginning with Toy Story in 1995. The firm, established in February 1986, has become a powerhouse animation studio for Disney, responsible for hits like\u00a0Ratatouille, WALL-E, Up, Brave and Monsters, Inc. Additionally, the studio has earned 15 Academy Awards, seven Golden Globe Awards, and eleven Grammy Awards. 'The wheels are turning.\u00a0And I'm thinking, 'We're in this post Sarbanes-Oxley world, and Enron and fiduciary responsibility, and he is going to be our largest shareholder and I'm now being asked to bury a secret.' Up until that point, only Jobs' wife Lauren Powell and his doctor knew he had cancer. According to excerpts from the book, after Jobs' revelation, Iger asked Alan Braverman, Disney's top lawyer for advice. Braverman quickly agreed that Disney could go ahead with the acquisition.\u00a0So the deal was done. However, just three years later, Jobs took a medical leave of absence. Iger said: 'In that three-year period, I always knew exactly what was going on with Steve medically. He and I would talk all the time, and since I kept things secret he confided in me.' The book, which will be published on Tuesday, paints a more sympathetic picture than the 2011 biography by Walter Isaacson, which focused on  Jobs' messy personal life and tough temperament. The Apple co-founder died in October 2011.",

        "document": "A British dance teacher shot dead by his son-in-law, who was also his former lover, may have molested at least four boys while running a dance school in Suffolk, it has emerged. Police have investigated four alleged victims who say they were abused in the 1980s and 1990s by Scott Rogers, who was killed in the US after becoming a local television celebrity there. Three of the men claiming that Rogers attacked them have only come forward after he was shot dead in August by Mathew Hodgkinson, who also killed himself. Investigation: Scott Rogers is accused of molesting at least four young boys while living in Britain . Rogers - known as Richard Scott-Rogers when he lived in Britain - was charged with abusing the other boy more than 20 years ago, but was cleared in 1993 after a trial. Before he moved to the US, Rogers founded the Academy of Dancing and Performing Arts in Bury St Edmunds, which was described as a 'supposedly religious cult' by the local council. Rogers allegedly held 'sleepovers' with young students, where he would 'cuddle them in their sleeping bags', according to parents. He then moved to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where he hosted a weekend morning TV show called Around Town, making him a minor celebrity in the area. But in August last year, Rogers, 52, was murdered by Mathew Hodgkinson, a former lover of his who had married his daughter Kimmy as part of an immigration scam. School: Rogers founded the Academy of Dancing and Performing Arts in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk in 1983 . Hodgkinson, 36, then turned the gun on himself, and died in hospital eight days later. After Rogers' death, Suffolk Police appealed for any victims to come forward, and were contacted by three men who said they were abused at the dance school in Bury St Edmunds. Killer: Rogers was shot dead in August by his son-in-law and ex-lover Mathew Hodgkinson, pictured . The force, working with officers from the Metropolitan Police's Operation Yewtree, recorded their claims and referred them to specialist agencies which support child abuse victims. However, they will not be able to take any further action because Rogers' death means the investigation has now been closed. A Suffolk Police crime report uncovered by a MailOnline freedom of information request said: 'Three new victims of child abuse reported to the Suffolk police sexual abuse by Richard Scott-Rogers. 'These historic incidents were recorded as notifiable crimes. Police provided support to these victims. There are no further lines of enquiry to complete in relation to the investigation with no other parties involvement. 'Given the suspect had died these crimes are therefore finalised in accordance with Home Office crime recording outcomes.' The three new victims brings the total number of British complainants to four, including the boy who made the original abuse claims in the 1990s. Following Rogers' death, it emerged that the authorities had recently taken away his adopted 10-year-old son and two-year-old foster son after finding out about his past. He was due to give evidence to a grand jury on the day he was killed, after police discovered that he had lied on the forms he used to apply to become a foster parent. Note: Hodgkinson left this note after killing Rogers and then shooting himself . Hodgkinson wrote an apparent suicide note found in the home he shared with his wife and father-in-law, saying: 'They broke our happy loving home. They do not get to take Scott too.' Soon after Rogers was killed, two anonymous British men appeared on a radio show and accused him of molesting them when they were young boys. One of the alleged victims, who said he met Rogers at the dance academy, claimed to have been abused from the age of 13. It is not known whether the men who made those claims are the same as the complainants who have contacted the police.",

She then circulated the images among her classmates before teachers became aware of the situation.

Fernando Alonso failed to make it out of Q1 and will start from 18th position in Sunday's Malaysian GP .

Alonso then posted a picture on Twitter of him dining out with Ron Dennis, the McLaren chairman, and team principal Eric Boullier. The snap comes after Alonso contradicted McLaren's version of events surrounding the mysterious testing crash which ruled him out of the race in Melbourne. \u2018Our form today wasn't unexpected but I think our performance so far this weekend has maybe been better than I'd have anticipated before arriving here in Malaysia,' Alonso added. \u2018However, the steps we're taking with the car show a lot of progress, so I'm optimistic that I won't be qualifying in Q1 for that much longer. \u2018This isn't an ideal position from which to start the race, but I'm fully aware that McLaren-Honda is a long-term project.

I'd like to think we could get closer to some of the cars in front tomorrow; that'll be something to look forward to. \u2018There are a lot of positives to take from this weekend: we've made a big step forwards in terms of pace.

        "document": "Whether it was a Druid temple, an astronomical calendar or a centre for healing, the mystery of Stonehenge has sparked endless debate over the centuries. Now a dramatic new theory suggests that the prehistoric stone circle monument was in fact 'an ancient Mecca on stilts'. The megaliths would not have been used for ceremonies at ground level, but would instead have supported a wooden platform on which ceremonies were performed to the rotating heavens, according to new research. Scroll down for video . Historian Julian Spalding has provided a new theory on Stonehenge. He says the stones were pillars used to support a raised platform during ceremonies. As shown in this illustration, steps or a ramp would have led to the top of the platform, where figures of importance would have stood, perhaps addressing a crowd below . Julian Spalding, former director of some of the UK's leading museums, argues that the stones were foundations for a vast platform, long since lost - 'a great altar' raised up high towards the heavens and able to take the weight of hundreds of worshippers. 'It's a totally different theory which has never been put forward before,' he said. 'All the interpretations to date could be mistaken. We've been looking at Stonehenge the wrong way, from the earth, which is very much a 20th-century viewpoint. We haven't been thinking about what they were thinking about.' Part of his evidence lies in ancient civilisations worldwide. As far afield as China, Peru and Turkey, such sacred monuments were built high up, whether on manmade or natural sites, and with circular patterns possibly linked to celestial movements. 'In early times, no spiritual ceremonies would have been performed on the ground,' said Mr Spalding. No-one is exactly sure why - and how - Stonehenge was built more than 4,000 years ago. Experts have suggested it was a temple, parliament and a graveyard. Some people think the stones have healing powers, while others think they have musical properties when struck with a stone. They could have acted as a giant musical instrument to call ancient people to the monument. What is clear, is that the stones were aligned with phases of the sun. People were buried there and skeletal evidence shows that people travelled hundreds of miles to visit Stonehenge - for whatever reason. Experts think that the route was a busy one and that Stonehenge could be viewed differently from different positions. It seems that instead of being a complete barrier, the Curcus acted as a gateway to guide visitors to the stone circle. 'The Pharaoh of Egypt and the Emperor of China were always carried - as the Pope used to be\u2026 The feet of holy people were not allowed to touch the ground. We've been looking at Stonehenge from a modern, earth-bound perspective. 'All the great raised altars of the past suggest that the people who built Stonehenge would never have performed celestial ceremonies on the lowly earth\u2026 That would have been unimaginably insulting to the immortal beings, for it would have brought them down from heaven to bite the dust and tread in the dung.' However, he says the wood that would have been used for the platform has long since rotted away, leaving only the stone pillars that support it behind. Mr Spalding's museum directorships include Glasgow, which boasts world-class archaeological collections within a complex of institutions that exceed the British Museum in size. Today, he published his theories in a new book, titled Realisation: From Seeing to Understanding - The Origins of Art, published by Wilmington Square Books. It explores our ancestors' understanding of the world, offering new explanations of iconic works of art and monuments. Shown is an illustration of a Druid ceremony at Stonehenge more than 4,000 years ago. This depiction does not take the new wooden platform theory into account . Stonehenge, built in stages between 3000 and 2000 BC, is England's most famous prehistoric monument, a Unesco World Heritage site on Salisbury Plain in Wiltshire that draws more than one million annual visitors. It began as a timber circle, later made permanent with massive blocks of stone, many somehow dragged from dolerite rock in the Welsh mountains. Dolerite has a bluish tinge and is dappled with white spots that look like stars, according to Mr Spalding. 'These megaliths, weighing between two and four tons each, were transported 250 miles [400km], an extraordinary achievement in those times, which indicates that building Stonehenge was a massive communal enterprise,' he said. Sacred circle: Julian Spalding, former director of some of the UK's leading museums, argues that the stones (aerial view shown) were foundations for a vast platform, long since lost - 'a great altar' raised up high towards the heavens and able to take the weight of hundreds of worshippers . Mystery: Previously it had been thought the arrangement of the stones was solely to align with the sun (shown), but Mr Spalding's new theory suggests they had another purpose as well . He believes that ancient worshippers would have reached the giant altar by climbing curved wooden ramps or staircases, moving in the direction of the slowly circulating stars for ceremonies dedicated to, for example, a dead king's soul or midsummer and solstice celebrations. His theories have been shaped by visits to ancient sites like the stone circles of G\u00f6bekli Tepe in southern Turkey, reminiscent of Stonehenge but predating it by around 6,000 years. Only a fraction of the site has been excavated, and the purpose of its T-shaped pillars is a mystery, Spalding said: 'These must have supported some sort of raised platform.' He also points to the Nazca Lines in Peru, vast drawings apparently etched into Earth's surface more than 2,000 years ago on to a high natural plateau above the villages where they lived: 'They went up to the sacred place. These lines were a processional way, which followed the movement and shape of the stars. 'The great mystery of early man was that we all thought the world was flat. Everyone did until very recent times. All the major religious ceremonies, as the Haj still does in Mecca, always ends in a circular motion, going round and round, which imitates the stars.' Holy: 'All the major religious ceremonies, as the Haj still does in Mecca, always ends in a circular motion, going round and round, which imitates the stars,' said Mr Spalding. Shown is Mecca in Saudi Arabia during Laylat al-Qadr, on the 27th of Ramadan, one of the holiest nights of the Islamic calendar . Professor Vincent Gaffney, principal investigator on the Stonehenge Hidden Landscapes Project at Bradford University, responded with 'a fair degree of scepticism.' He said: 'At Stonehenge, there are other structures which are clearly designed to be viewed from the ground, along astronomic alignments, and you can see the sky from pretty much anywhere.' Sir Barry Cunliffe, a prehistorian and Emeritus Professor of European Archaeology, Oxford University, said: 'He could be right, but I know of no evidence to support it\u2026 There are a large number of stone circles around the country which clearly didn't have a platform on top. So why should Stonehenge?' But Aubrey Burl, an authority on prehistoric stone circles, said: 'There could be something in it. There is a possibility, of course. Anything new and worthwhile about Stonehenge is well worth looking into, but with care and consideration.' Mr Spalding also points to the Nazca Lines in Peru ('hands' design shown), vast drawings apparently etched into Earth's surface more than 2,000 years ago on to a high natural plateau above the villages where they lived, as being similar in purpose to Stonehenge . Mr Spalding is fully expecting resistance from fellow academics. He draws parallels with the 1868 discovery of magnificent prehistoric ceiling paintings in the Altamira Cave in Spain, by a geologist and archaeologist. 'He went in there and looked on the ground - because he assumed all the evidence for early man would be on the ground,' he said. 'It never occurred to him to look up. It was his young daughter who said, papa look on the ceiling.' Experts at the time denounced those paintings as forgeries. It was not until the end of the 19th century that they were accepted as genuine.",

        "document": "A team of scientists claim it has found a way to inject people\u2019s eyes with \u2018night vision\u2019. The research gave one volunteer the ability to see more than 164ft (50 metres) in almost total darkness for 'several hours'. By injecting his eyes with a liquid solution, he could spot people running among trees in dark conditions 100 per cent of the time, while others who hadn't been treated with the drops were successful in only a third of cases. Californian researchers have developed a liquid that enables night vision. The solution combines Chlorin e6 (Ce6) with insulin and saline. A small amount of it was dripped it into a researcher's eyes. It briefly turns the eyes dark or black before it is absorbed, seen in this image of researcher Gabriel Licina . The experiment was carried out by a group of so-called \u2018biohackers\u2019 in California called Science for the Masses. They used a solution of a substance called Chlorin e6 (Ce6), which is found in some deep-sea fish and has light-amplification properties, and is also been used in cancer treatment research. Combining Ce6 with insulin and saline, the team produced a solution that can increase vision in low light conditions. In April, researchers revealed a super-thin infrared light sensor, which could become an invaluable tool for the soldiers of the future as researchers work to develop the advance into night vision contact lenses. Created by University of Michigan researchers Ted Norris and Zhaohui Zhong, the sensor uses an atom-thin material called graphene which could be layered onto contact lenses. Graphene takes infrared rays and translates them into electrical signals. The process is similar to the way silicon chip in a digital camera work with visible light, Wired reported. 'If we integrate it with a contact lens or other wearable electronics, it expands your vision,' Zhong said. 'It provides you another way of interacting with your environment.' They note in their paper, though, that \u2018the high risk of cellular toxicity from outside contaminants being absorbed through the skin make this chemical something that should only be handled with caution.\u2019 As a result it is not advisable for people to carry out the procedure themselves at home. Russell Peake, Eye Health Condition Manager at Boots Opticians, told MailOnline that people should not attempt to recreate the experiment. 'Unless a solution has been prescribed or recommended by an optometrist, GP or pharmacist, people should not be inserting anything into their eyes,' he warned. 'An invasive eye procedure should only ever be undertaken by a trained expert in a clinical environment, as wrong use could lead to disruption or damage of the eye\u2019s surface or tears, potentially leading to vision loss. 'Whilst the idea of \"night vision eye drops\" may seem interesting, this appears to be an unlicensed and unproven solution that has no medical approval. 'We would strongly advise against anyone trying this at home as the risks could potentially be very damaging and would advise people speak to their local optician for further information or advice.' The experiment was carried out by a group of so-called \u2018biohackers\u2019 in California called Science for the Masses. It is not advisable to try this at home. They used a solution containing Chlorin e6 (Ce6), found in some deep-sea fish and has light-amplification properties, and is also used in cancer treatment research . In the team's experiment, the liquid was dripped onto the conjunctival sacs on the eye of Gabriel Licina, one of the researchers, which carried the solution to his retinas. \u2018Ce6 solution was added to the conjunctival sac via micropippette at three doses of 50\u03bcl [microlitres] into each eye,\u2019 the researchers wrote. The solution  initially made his eyes turn black, before being absorbed in a few seconds and returning his eyes to their natural colour. 'To me, it was a quick, greenish-black blur across my vision, and then it dissolved into my eyes,' Mr Licina told Mic. However, to \u2018reduce the potential for bright light exposure,\u2019 the team covered his eyes in black contact lenses. Within an hour his vision had noticeably improved in low-light conditions. To test the effects, Mr Licina and four \u2018control\u2019 subjects who had not been given the solution were taken to a \u2018darkened area\u2019. Within an hour, Mr Licina was able to see in darkness - for several hours. In experiments he could see three times better than 'normal' eyes. After testing, Mr Licina wore sunglasses while he slept, and his eyesight in the morning seemed to return to normal. Shown is a stock image of US soldiers in Iraq in 2003 . They were then asked to identify symbols in the dark, either moving or still, and to spot individuals moving in a small grove of trees. \u2018The Ce6 subject consistently recognised symbols that did not seem to be visible to the controls,\u2019 the researchers wrote. And, in the second test: \u2018The Ce6 subject identified the distant figures 100 per cent of the time, with the controls showing a 33 per cent identification rate.\u2019 After testing, the team said that Mr Licina wore sunglasses while he slept, and his eyesight in the morning appeared to return to normal. \u2018As of 20 days, there have been no noticeable effects,\u2019 they said. While they note that more testing is needed, the initial results suggest that the technique can provide low light amplification in the human eye. \u2018Further testing is need to confirm and measure the degree of improvement in health subjects,\u2019 they concluded.",

        "document": "Former Labor leader Mark Latham was dumped from a radio interview for an on-air rant that included calling Triple M host Gus Worland a 'loveable f***wit' and movie star Hugh Jackman a 'North Shore w***er.' Now Worland wants to punch Latham's head in - for charity. Mr Latham, who was opposition leader for 13 months from December 2003 and led Labor to lose the 2004 election, had been invited on to the station's Grill Team morning program to talk about his latest book. Scroll down for audio . The Grill Team on radio station Triple M says 'it's on!' A fight for charity between the 'Marathon Man' Gus Worland (left) and former Labor heavyweight, Mark Latham (right) The program is co-hosted by Worland, who is also known for reality TV progams including An Aussie Goes Barmy. An audio recording had earlier emerged of Mr Latham talking to another Triple M presenter, Merrick Watts, about Worland's latest TV show, Gus Worland: Marathon Man, which document's the presenter's efforts to get fit and run the New York Marathon. 'I actually watched Gus' Marathon Man show, flicking through Foxtel one night, and hooked into it on the basis it's got to be the worst TV ever. It lived up to expectations, it was f***ing horrendous,' Latham said in the audio, which was not put to air. 'It was shocking but I couldn't work out he wasn't losing any weight, how's this fat tub going to run a marathon, they ended up shoving tubes up his a***.' 'No doubt I'll drop him like a bad habit,' Latham fired back at Worland. 'I'll knock him into tomorrow and he can whack his mate Hugh Jackman in for seconds.' His criticisms led to The Grill Team - Worland, Mark Geyer and Matthew Johns - urging Mr Latham to come on their show and talk about his book, Latham at large. Mr Latham did not back down from his criticism talking directly to Worland and his colleagues. 'The best s*** TV in the history of the entertainment industry,' was how Mr Latham described Worland's show. He went on to take a swipe at Worland's previous TV efforts focusing on cricket, but left his harshest criticism for last. 'Gus, I\u2019ve been talking to Davey Gyngell down there at Channel 9 and we\u2019re gonna put a proposition to you, you\u2019ve got a lot of talent ... so Gyngell and I want to make you an offer to put on a new variety show, prime time, channel ...' But Mr Latham was taken off air before he could finish his sentence. Co-host Johns explained why. 'He said he wanted to call the show, Gus Worland Loveable F***wit,' Johns said. Gus Worland (middle) is a radio host on The Grill Team heard on Triple M in Sydney, he's pictured with colleagues Mark Geyer (left) and Matthew Johns (right) No backing out now. Social media has already lit up with news of the fight between Latham and Worland and they are already putting odds on it . After the awkward on-air episode, Triple M said Worland wanted to take the stoush further. Worland 'has challenged Mark Latham to a boxing match after the ex-Labor leader called him a \"f***wit\" live on-air,' Triple M said in a statement. It explained the whole incident like this: . 'Latham was in to talk about his book, which Gus called \"rubbish\"\u2026 after the ex-Labor leader slagged of his\u00a0TV show, calling it the \"worst television show in the history of the media\". 'This really p***** Gus off. He called him a \"failed opposition leader, a failed pollie\" that \"even Labor don't even care\" about. Gus Worland pictured with his best mate, none other than Hugh Jackman. Mark Latham says he'll knock them both out . Mark Latham said of Gus Worland and his best mate Hugh Jackman (pictured starring in the movie series Wolverine) 'all those north shore w*****rs', seriously, I'll knock them out of the ring'. 'He then challenged the former pollie to a boxing match for charity.\u00a0Looks like someone is gonna get hurt.' 'I want to put on a boxing match,' Worland said.\u00a0'Three rounds. I\u2019ll take him on for charity after what he said.' 'No doubt I'll drop him like a bad habit,' Latham fired back. 'I'll knock him into tomorrow and he can whack his mate Hugh Jackman in for seconds. All those North Shore wankers, seriously, I'll knock them out of the ring.' Mr Latham ended by daring Worland to name the time and place. Mr Latham grew up in Sydney's blue-collar south-western suburbs, and represented the area in Parliament for the seat of Werriwa. Known for a brash, sometimes abrasive personality, Mr Latham allegedly broke a taxi driver's arm in 2001 during a fare dispute and is also remembered for a quite aggressive, in-your-face, handshake with John Howard during the 2004 election campaign.",

        "document": "Jerusalem (CNN)Either Benjamin Netanyahu just staged the most dramatic political comeback in Israeli history and beyond, or something was very wrong with the polls before and during the election. Polls predicted a tight race coming down to the wire, with Netanyahu in a virtual tie with his main challenger, Isaac Herzog of the Zionist Union party. Only four days before the election, polls showed Herzog taking a four-seat lead into the final weekend before the election. Exit polls on the night of the election showed Netanyahu had closed the gap. The polls suggested he was in a dead heat, with a very even split between right-wing and left-wing parties. Then came the results. Not more polls or surveys, but actual counts from the ballot boxes. Netanyahu wasn't in a fight for his political life after all. He was the clear winner, running away with the election and facing a fairly clear path to create a coalition government. Although the results are unofficial, it seems almost certain that Netanyahu will remain the Israeli prime minister. Avi Degani, a pollster, professor at Tel Aviv University and president of the Geocartography Knowledge Group, saw very different results from his own polls. He never anticipated a Zionist Union victory. Instead, he says, he always saw Likud holding a lead. The mistake that others made, according to Degani, was in the methodology. \"The Internet does not represent the state of Israel and the people of Israel,\" he said, referring to modern statistical methods. \"It represents panels, and the panels are biased strongly to the center -- Tel Aviv, better-educated, more participants in this kind of conversation. And people who are in the periphery and so on and have the stronger tendency to vote Likud, I think, are poorly represented.\" \"I have tested sometimes at the same night, doing by telephone as I do always -- and very specifically geographically, and very well-weighted and very well, having cell phones and other phones and so on -- and at the same time I did on the Internet. And I got results which are very, very different.\" But Mina Tzemach, the polling expert for CNN affiliate Channel 2 Israel, suggests Netanyahu was in a tight race the entire way and managed to close the gap \"like a magician,\" using the election polls as his final trick. \"The polls showed that they are going to lose. It gave very important information both to the public and to the politicians. Netanyahu used it,\" said Tzemach. \"Many voted what we call strategic voting. They did not vote to the party that is their first preference, but they voted for the Likud.\" Likud voters did not participate in exit polls, according to Tzemach, and that skewed the results, leading many to believe that Herzog had tied Netanyahu. \"We had ballots in an area where there are a lot of immigrants from the former Soviet Union,\" explained Tzemach. \"In these ballots, more than 30% did not participate in our polls, and they are Likud supporters.\" Another factor that may have worked in Netanyahu's favor was his Likud party cannibalizing votes from other right-wing parties. In the days before the election, Netanyahu moved to the political right, making a big push for right-wing voters to choose his party over other ideologically similar parties, such as Naftali Bennett's Jewish Home party and Avigdor Lieberman's Yisrael Beiteinu party. During the weekend before the election, Netanyahu took part in a right-wing rally in Tel Aviv's central Rabin Square. He continued his shift to the right in a series of interviews with local media leading up to the election. His most controversial statement came the day before the elections when he reversed his publicly stated position on a two-state solution. \"Anyone who is going to establish a Palestinian state, anyone who is going to evacuate territories today, is simply giving a base for attacks to the radical Islam against Israel,\" he said in a television interview. \"This is the true reality that was created here in the last few years.\" In 2009, in a speech known as the Bar Ilan speech, Netanyahu committed to negotiations for a two-state solution, saying, \"Let us begin peace negotiations immediately without prior conditions. Israel is committed to international agreements, and expects all sides to fulfill their obligations. I say to the Palestinians: We want to live with you in peace, quiet, and good neighborly relations.\" Tzemach estimates that Likud took four seats from Jewish Home and two more seats from Yachad, a party that did not receive enough votes to warrant inclusion in the Knesset, Israel's parliament. Exit polls in Israel have been wrong before. In the most recent elections in 2013, exit polls showed Yair Lapid's centrist Yesh Atid party winning between 12 and 13 seats in the Knesset. But when the final results were tallied, Lapid won 19 seats, becoming a major player in the government. This time, the unexpected surprise worked in Netanyahu's favor, turning the campaign race into an election night rout. Likud had never polled better than approximately 25 seats, but it grabbed at least 29 of the 120 seats in the Knesset, according to unofficial numbers from the Israeli election committee based on 99% of the vote. Netanyahu has worked this sort of magic once before. In the 1996 elections, early results showed the Labor Party's Shimon Peres as the winner, but as more results came in, Netanyahu eked out a victory by fewer than 1% of the votes. Degani said this election reveals the truth behind Israeli politics. \"This last election it showed very clearly that we do not have right and left. We have only right and extreme right, which is not nice sometimes. And in the right, you have the Likud mostly, and in the Likud, you have mostly Netanyahu.\"",

Stephen O\u2019Meara, 31, formerly of Datchet, Buckinghamshire was today locked up for 13 years for conspiracy to supply cocaine in February and August 2013. The drugs were transported in two loads and flown on British Airways flights to Heathrow Airport, Southwark Crown Court heard.

Drugs and ammunition: Police intercepted 40 kilos of cocaine (left) together with 100 rounds of 9mm ammunition . In total, police intercepted 40 kilos of cocaine with purity levels of more than 90% and a street level value of \u00a311 million, together with 100 rounds of 9mm ammunition. Gang leader Harvinder Sanghera, 33, of Heston, Hounslow, London was caged for 30 years for importing cocaine and ammunition, while his \u2018right hand man\u2019 Savdeep Atkar, 33, of Grays, Essex was sentenced to 21 years for importing cocaine. Former boxer and personal trainer O\u2019Meara was handed a 13-year sentence, as was David Brown, 51, of\u00a0Biggleswade, Bedfordshire for\u00a0supplying cocaine. Mark Graffius, defending O\u2019Meara, said the former professional boxer met Sanghera while acting as his personal trainer. Sanghera and Aktar would watch O\u2019Meara as he took part in sparring sessions, the court was told. Father-of-two O\u2019Meara was a \u2018gifted and dedicated\u2019 boxer boxer who was \u2018literally on the very cusp of becoming a top level international,\u2019 according to Mr Graffius. He was managed by leading boxing promoter Frank Warren and had planned to move abroad to Spain where he was on the threshold of a \u2018major, life-changing event.\u2019 Sanghera was described as a \u2018family man\u2019 with two small children, who accrued a number of large debts through gambling. Jailed: Savdeep Atkar (left),\u00a0David Brown (centre) and\u00a0Harvinder Sanghera (right) were sentenced with\u00a0Stephen O\u2019Meara today . It was said Sanghera, who previously worked on a perfume production line in Acton, joined the drug conspiracy because he \u2018owed debts to people you shouldn\u2019t owe debts'. Aktar was described as a man brought up by a \u2018hard-working\u2019 and \u2018god-fearing\u2019 family. Brown was said to be a person who \u2018tends to say yes to people.\u2019 Sentencing the men, Judge Robbins said: \u2018You four in your own different ways played your parts in ensuring that some very large quantities of cocaine were imported into this country. \u2018You know very well the devastating effects these drugs may have on poor individuals. \u2018The wholesale value of 40 kilogrammes of cocaine would have been more than \u00a32m, but the street value much higher. \u2018This was a sophisticated, well organised, and determined criminal network. \u2018Those towards the top end of the organisation, Atkar and Sanghera, were capable of masterminding and resourcing such an operation.\u2019 Police intercepted the drugs and ammunition.

        "document": "A teacher in Ohio has filed a lawsuit claiming that he was fired 'because he opposed dairy farming, on his personal Facebook page, on his own time.' Keith Allison of Smithville was a second grade title one teacher at Green Elementary School working with small groups of kids who needed extra help with their math and English. According to a lawsuit filed on Wednesday at the U.S. District Court in Cleveland, school administrators told him he his contract wouldn't be renewed because of photos he had posted online showing baby calves in small crates. Keith Allison of Smithville, Ohio, has filed a lawsuit claiming that he was fired by Green Local School District 'because he opposed dairy farming, on his personal Facebook page, on his own time' Along with the photos, Allison - who is a vegan \u2013 had also posted a message voicing his support for animals rights. 'As someone who grew up feeling parental love and support, and now as a parent who gives love and support, I reject the claim that separating babies from loving mothers to raise them isolated in boxes can ever be considered humane,' he wrote on the post. Allison was told by his superintendent that the family that owns this farm had called and complained about it and said they were upset and frightened by the post. 'The fact that their family's farm was in the picture, I guess, is where their complaint was coming from and from what I was told, they were fearful, afraid that someone might come and break their calf crates or free their cows and their children were not safe to be out in their yards,' he told Fox 8. 'During the meeting with my superintendent, I was informed we live in a large agricultural area, which is true, and that a lot of our money for the schools comes through residents of the community and that I needed to be very careful of what i put on (Facebook) because I might offend the community and the economic interests of the community,' said Allison. According to a lawsuit, school administrators told him he his contract wouldn't be renewed because of photos he had posted online showing baby calves in small crates (stock photo) 'I was also told that I could have any personal beliefs I want to have, but if I want to be a strong Vegan advocate, I might want to look into doing something other than teaching.' The lawsuit says the Board of Education of Green Local School District has a policy that teachers cannot speak about issues if members of the community disagree with their views. Allison and the American Civil Liberties Union, which filed the lawsuit on his behalf, say the policy is unconstitutional and are suing the district to remove it. They are also asking for back pay and damages and to reinstate him into his old position, even though he was hired at a middle school in the district in January.",

Palace face Queens Park Rangers in Saturday\u2019s lunchtime kick-off at Selhurst Park and their manager Chris Ramsey is the only ethnic minority boss in the Barclays Premier League. Pardew wants clubs to work on encouraging ethnic minority coaches to reflect the huge variety of cultures that players in England come from, rather than employing the same \u201cboys club\u201d members. Palace manager Alan Pardew believes that English football isn't doing enough to include black coaches . Chris Ramsey, QPR boss, is the only black coach in the top flight - and one of just six in the Football League . Ramsey is one of just six black or ethnic minorities bosses in the Football League, along with Huddersfield Town boss Chris Powell, Brighton\u2019s Chris Hughton, Carlisle manager Keith Curle, Leyton Orient boss Fabio Liverani and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink with Burton Albion. \u2018He (Ramsey) is black, which I think is great for the Premier League,\u2019 Pardew said. \u2018It\u2019s something that I want to promote here in terms of our coaches, because the percentage of players we have to percentage of coaches in terms of origin isn\u2019t right.\u2019 Palace employ just \u2018three or four\u2019 black coaches, according to Pardew and in future recruitment he plans to change that, while backing the idea of a \u2018Rooney Rule\u2019 as seen in American Football where a black coach is considered for every job. \u2018I\u2019m going to keep approaching when vacancies come up and make sure that we are covering every kind of opportunity in terms of applications that come in,\u2019 he said. \u2018It isn\u2019t \u201cjobs for the boys\u201d here anymore, I\u2019m not saying it was, but sometimes it does go like that. Ramsey takes a coaching session at the QPR training ground this week ahead of his side's trip to Palace . Former Chelsea striker Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink is currently managing League Two outfit Burton Albion . \u2018I think something like that (the Rooney Rule) could be looked at. I also know the LMA and the PFA are really trying to encourage a more diverse approach to getting different creeds to come into the coaching world and I just want to take this opportunity to back that up. Pardew also looked to push forward the prospects of more Asian footballers coming into the game after signing South Korean winger Lee Chung-yong from Bolton Wanderers in the January transfer window. And Pardew says Palace, based in the ethnically diverse area of South Norwood outside London, owe it to their surroundings to be more culturally diverse. \u2018I don\u2019t want to talk just about Afro-Caribbean coaches either,\u2019 he said. \u2018We have an Asian player now in our first team. We don\u2019t have a lot of that and that\u2019s another area that we need to promote, Asian footballers in this area because there\u2019s a lot of huge community here. \u2018We need a greater influx of Indians, Afro-Caribbeans, entering our coaching system and getting jobs, so the proportions make sense.\u2019 Crystal Palace signed Lee Chung-yong from Bolton Wanderers during the January transfer window .",

The dog fell over the edge of a chalk cliff at an old quarry, which overlooks a residential street in Chafford Hundred, Essex, and landed on a narrow ledge about 30ft from the top. The animal spent two days on the cliff face before its barks were eventually heard by nearby residents. The  Jack Russell, called Jake, was rescued by a team of firefighters (pictured together) from a 165ft-high cliff face after spending two days stuck on a ledge after falling off the edge of  cliff in Chafford Hundred, Essex . The ten-year-old dog was coaxed back to safety by firefighters, who were lowered down onto the cliff ledge before offering the animal food. Jake has now been taken in by the RSPCA which is trying to find its owner . The dog became stuck on a ledge\u00a030ft from the top of this chalk cliff face in Chafford Hundred, Essex . Fire crews spent four hours rescuing the animal yesterday and managed to retrieve it after firefighters were lowered down to the ledge on ropes and coaxed it to safety with food. Incident commander John Harris, of Essex County Fire and Rescue Service, said: 'Jake was trapped on a small ledge about 10 metres from the top of the cliff. 'It's a sheer drop of about 50 metres so he was in a bit of a predicament. 'Neighbours told us that he's been on there for a couple of days at least because they've heard him barking and yelping. 'The team used lines to lower themselves down the cliff to the ledge Jake was on. 'They had a basket to put Jake in and bring him back up.' He added: 'At first Jake was scared and backed away from them but they had taken some food with them and they used that to coax him over and get him in the box. The dog spent two days on the ledge of the chalk cliff and was eventually found after neighbours reported hearing its barks. Firefighters coaxed it into a cage and returned it to safety (pictured) by offering it dog food . The dog became stuck on the ledge of a chalk cliff face (pictured behind the houses) in Chafford Hundred, Essex. Neighbours alerted the fire service after hearing barking for two days and realising it was stuck . 'He had been there for a few days and was very hungry but didn't appear to be too worse for wear following his ordeal.' The animal was checked over by a vet and is now in the hands of the RSPCA which is trying to find the dog's owner. The RSPCA said: 'We were able to take the dog to a local vet and fortunately other than being shaken up and cold he seemed to be fine and is currently being checked over. 'We would always advise people to be careful when walking their dogs near cliffs and to keep them on the lead if there is any risk of danger.'",

        "document": "A mother whose son suffered brain damage at birth has been awarded \u00a35.2million after a 16-year battle with the NHS. Scotland\u2019s highest court had twice rejected Nadine Montgomery\u2019s claim that medical negligence caused her son\u2019s physical disabilities. But in a landmark legal ruling seven judges of the Supreme Court in London upheld the 40-year-old mother\u2019s claim in what was described as \u2018the most significant medical negligence judgment in 30 years\u2019. Nadine Montgomery, whose son suffers from cerebral palsy after he was starved of oxygen during birth, argued she was not properly advised on having a Cesarean by medics at NHS Lanarkshire . Mrs Montgomery expressed delight yesterday that the care of her son, Sam, who suffers from cerebral palsy, was now guaranteed. The biologist from Cumbernauld, Lanarkshire, said: \u2018This is an enormous relief after a long legal fight, ensuring Sam receives the best care for the rest of his life.\u2019 First-time mother Mrs Montgomery gave birth to her son in Bellshill Maternity Hospital, run by NHS Lanarkshire, in October 1999. The slightly-built Type 1 diabetic claimed that during her pregnancy she expressed concerns about the birth. Shoulder dystocia occurs when a baby becomes stuck during delivery, potentially starving the infant of oxygen and leading to brain defects. It is particularly common among the children of diabetes sufferers, which are often larger than typical children. Ms Montgomery, a type 1 diabetes sufferer, said the risks of natural delivery, and the prospect of having a Cesarean, were not discussed with her. Her son, Sam, suffered from shoulder dystocia during birth, and now has cerebral palsy. It is recognised that diabetic mothers can deliver larger babies, placing them at higher risk of complications, including the possibility of \u2018shoulder dystocia\u2019 where a newborn gets stuck in the pelvis. In her case, Sam\u2019s shoulder stuck after delivery of his head. Staff released the shoulder but during a 12-minute delay he suffered oxygen deprivation. He was later diagnosed with cerebral palsy, caused by permanent brain injury at birth. Mrs Montgomery claimed that had she been advised properly, she would have opted for the alternative of a Caesarean section and Sam would have been born uninjured. But she said her obstetrician Dr Dina McLellan decided not to discuss the risks or suggest a Caesarean. At an earlier hearing, judges heard it was not Dr McLellan\u2019s \u2018practice\u2019 to discuss the potential risks of shoulder dystocia, claiming that the risk for the baby was very small, and that Caesareans were not in the \u2018maternal interests\u2019 of women. Mrs Montgomery\u2019s case for compensation had twice been rejected by the Court of Session in Edinburgh. But Lord Reed, who delivered the Supreme Court Justices\u2019 decision yesterday said: \u2018An adult person of sound mind is entitled to decide which, if any, of the available forms of treatment to undergo, and her consent must be obtained before treatment interfering with her bodily integrity is undertaken. Her claim for compensation was twice rejected by Scotland's highest court, but she was yesterday awarded \u00a35.2million after London's Supreme Court overturned the ruling (file image) \u2018There can be no doubt it was incumbent on Dr McLellan to advise Mrs Montgomery of the risk of shoulder dystocia if she were to have her baby by vaginal delivery, and to discuss with her the alternative of delivery by Caesarean. \u2018The only conclusion we can reasonably reach is that, had she (the consultant) advised Mrs Montgomery of the risk of shoulder dystocia and discussed with her dispassionately the potential consequences, Mrs Montgomery would probably have elected to be delivered of her baby by Caesarean section. It is not in dispute that the baby would then have been born unharmed.\u2019 A relieved Mrs Montgomery said: \u2018This judgement is an enormous relief after a very long legal fight. I believe that I have a right to know of all the risks surrounding Sam's birth and I am pleased the Supreme Court has recognised that. 'I hope this means other patients will not have to go through what I have gone through. The decision will allow me to ensure Sam receives the best possible care for the rest of his life.' Dr Iain Wallace, Medical Director at NHS Lanarkshire, said: \u2018Since this case, practices have changed significantly. Women are more fully informed and advised of the risks and complications of pregnancy. 'We are disappointed in the Supreme Court's decision which has applied retrospectively to the law relating to informed consent and to this case. 'We have only just received this judgement and will need time to consider it fully. We understand, however, that it materially changes the law relating to consent and we, along with other health boards in the UK, will need time to consider very carefully any potential implications for future service provision.'",

An Osceola County, Florida mother has been arrested after authorities said they found her two young daughters going door to door trying to sell their toys. The Osceola County Sheriff\u2019s Office says the girls, ages 7 and 9, were walking barefoot about a half-mile from their home about 10:30 a.m. Thursday. The girls told deputies they were selling their toys 'to help mommy stay in the house.' The girls had missed a 7:20 a.m. bus to school, deputies said. The deputies found the mother, April Emery, at home sleeping. According to investigators, when deputies woke her up she said she blamed her daughters for not waking her up at school time. WTSP reports that Emery did not seem to be concerned about her daughters' well being. When deputies told her they found her daughters walking around, she told them, 'Well they should know better, it's their job to wake me up in the morning to get ready for school.' Emery was charged with child neglect without great bodily harm. The arrest was reported to the state Department of Children and Families, which had investigated previous allegations of poor child care at the home. According to the sheriff\u2019s office, the home had running water, electricity and food, and the girls were were wearing clean clothes and had toys 'to keep them entertained.'

        "document": "Manchester City striker Wilfried Bony believes the champions now have to target victory in every remaining game to retain their title. City remain five points behind Barclays Premier League leaders Chelsea after slipping to a 2-1 defeat at Liverpool on Sunday. The London side also have a game in hand and City have just 11 matches left to turn the situation around. Wilfried Bony says Manchester City can still retain the Premier League if they win all their remaining games . Bony has only made appearances from the bench so far for City, and was booked in the defeat by Liverpool . Bony said: 'It is disappointing, we have made it difficult for ourselves now. 'If Chelsea win (their game in hand) it will be more difficult for us to get close to them. But we still hope - there are 11 more games and every game we just have to win, be positive for the rest of the league and try to get maximum points. 'We need to win, win, win and hope Chelsea will drop some points. It is a difficult moment for us but we still hope we can do it.' Bony might hope to play a greater role in City's run-in after making just three goalless substitute appearances since signing from Swansea in January. City were beaten 2-1 at Anfield after stunning strikes from Jordan Henderson and Coutinho (above) Bony will hope to make more of an impact on the title run-in than he has been able to so far since signing . In between Henderson and Coutinho's strikes Edin Dzeko equalised, but City were well beaten . Bony did not feature for a month after the move was completed due to his involvement in Ivory Coast's African Nations Cup win and has had to make do with coming off the bench since. His 78th-minute introduction at Anfield came with his side already 2-1 down and he was unable to affect the outcome. His only notable contribution to the game came when he was booked for an aerial challenge on Adam Lallana that arguably could have been worth a red card. City had cancelled out Jordan Henderson's superb early strike with a well-worked Edin Dzeko equaliser but the outstanding Philippe Coutinho restored the hosts' lead with a 75th-minute stunner. Sergio Aguero had hit the post and he spurned two other good chances, while David Silva also went close late on, but Liverpool dominated and ultimately deserved their victory. Manuel Pellegrini insists he will keep focusing on his own team's games rather than watching Chelsea . Pellegrini defended his selection after he stuck with the same line-up that thrashed Newcastle last week . Manager Manuel Pellegrini will continue to chase Chelsea but the challenge from below is strengthening, with third-placed Arsenal just four points behind. Pellegrini said: 'We are worried about our team, not the other teams that are behind us. It is important to try and continue playing the normal way. 'In the last two games in the Premier League we scored nine goals and we won the two games. That is why we repeated the same starting 11. 'This is more important than to be worried about things you cannot manage.'",

        "document": "South Africa skipper AB de Villiers' accomplished showing with bat and ball helped the Proteas to a 146-run World Cup victory over the United Arab Emirates in Wellington. De Villiers underpinned South Africa's innings with a sparkling 82-ball 99 as they reached 341 for six, before taking two for 15 from three overs as the UAE were bowled out for 195 in response with 15 balls remaining. De Villiers surprisingly fell one run short of his century, but will take consolation from having smashed four sixes to take his total to 20 at this showpiece - the most at the tournament - and a record 36 in 21 World Cup matches overall. South Africa captain AB de Villiers (right) inspired his country to a comfortable win against the UAE . The explosive batsman hit 99 for the Proteas as they continued they impressive form in the World Cup . De Villers also took two wickets with the ball at the Wellington Regional Stadium on Thursday . The victory was as comfortable as the margin suggests for South Africa as the UAE slumped to a fifth defeat in as many World Cup games. The Proteas, already through to the knockout phase, set the formidable target after being asked to bat first at Westpac Stadium. De Villiers shared a 108-run fourth-wicket stand with David Miller, after Hashim Amla (12), Quinton de Kock (26) and Rilee Rossouw (43) had departed, and added a further 53 in partnership with JP Duminy. Miller was dismissed one run short of his half-century at the start of the 37th over, bowled by Mohammad Naveed, who claimed figures of three for 63. De Villiers had been let off the hook on 63 when he offered a caught-and-bowled chance trying to go down the ground to Amjad Javed, and looked set to notch his hundred only to slice a wide length ball from Kamran Shazad straight to Javed at short third man. His departure signalled the arrival of Farhaan Behardien, though, and his quick-fire 64 not out from just 31 deliveries kept the South African score racing along. Farhaan Bahardien also shone for South Africa with the bat in Wellington . UAE have lost all five of their World Cup games so far this year and were 45-3 after 12.3 overs . Duminy (23) became Naveed's third victim when he was trapped lbw, but Behardien and Vernon Philander (10 not out) took the total past 300 in an unbroken 49-run seventh-wicket stand. The UAE's long-shot chances of chasing down that total were dealt a heavy blow as they slumped to 45 for three after just 12.3 overs. Morne Morkel led the early charge for the Proteas, dismissing Andri Berenger (five) and Khurram Khan (12) as he took two for four from his first four overs, while Duminy claimed Amjad Ali's (21) wicket in between. Shaiman Anwar and Swapnil Patil put on 63 in a fourth-wicket stand that provided a brief respite, but when Anwar (39) sent Imran Tahir's delivery straight to mid-wicket they began to tumble again. Saqlain Haider (seven) replaced Anwar at the crease, but he only lasted three overs to become De Villiers' first victim of the day, before Javed (five) followed suit soon after to leave the UAE on 125 for six with 15.4 overs left. De Villiers rounded off his display with a simple catch as Naveed (17) top-edged Philander tamely to mid-wicket and the subsequent departures of Mohammad Tauqir (three) and Shazad (nought) meant the UAE fell short of completing their 50 overs. Swapnil Patil wsa the only plus point in the batting display as he passed 50 .",

Sanchez's Chile meet Brazil in a repeat of last summer's World Cup second-round clash at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday, and the Arsenal forward has been making the most of his home comforts between training sessions with his international colleagues. In what seems a slightly unusual way of preparing for a game, the 26-year-old has been taking his dogs around the pitches during the international break. Alexis Sanchez is pictured with his two dogs Atom and Humber during training with Chile on Saturday . The Chile star joined his two dogs for a jog around Arsenal's London Colney base ahead of facing Brazil . Dog-loving Sanchez's canine duo Atom and Humber were pictured accompanying their owner on a jog around the north London base. Sunday's South American showdown at the Emirates pits Sanchez against his former Barcelona team-mate Neymar, who he still holds a close friendship with. The pair last met at the World Cup, with Neymar's Brazil prevailing on penalties. Sanchez had scored Chile's first-half equaliser in Belo Horizonte but missed in the shoot-out before Neymar sealed the win for the hosts. The game against Brazil at the Emirates Stadium reunites Sanchez with his former team-mate Neymar . The pair spent a year together at Barcelona before Sanchez was sold on to Arsenal last summer . 'I'm so excited and honoured to be playing for the national team of Chile, against our great rivals Brazil, in front of the incredible Arsenal fans at Emirates Stadium,' Sanchez said. 'I also look forward to playing against my good friend Neymar. 'Matches between Brazil and Chile are always exciting encounters, and for me, to play this game at Emirates Stadium will make the match even more special.' Training at London Colney with Chile is a familiar experience for Sanchez, as it is usually Arsenal's base . The 26-year-old forward has had an impressive season since arriving in the Barclays Premier League .",

        "document": "This video shows the shocking moment an Uber driver threw a man to the ground 'in self-defence' during a brawl on the streets of central London. The taxi driver, wearing a black coat and white cap, can be seen grappling with a man next to his white car, with the driver door wide open. As the man wearing a beige jacket, who is believed to be a member of the public, throws punches at the cabbie, the driver suddenly picks him up and slams him to the ground. Shocking: An Uber driver (wearing black) was seen grappling with a member of the public in central London . Apparently in 'self-defence', the driver picks up the man and throws him to the ground on Shaftesbury Avenue . As onlookers shout out of shot, the man gets to his feet and dusts himself off before kicking the driver in the shin. At this point people intervene to stop the brawl, which happened on Shaftesbury Avenue in Soho, central London, on Wednesday evening. The driver, who works for Uber, claims he was on his way to a job when the man pulled open the driver-side door as he was waiting to allow pedestrians across the road. A spokesman for Uber, which allows people to book cabs using a mobile app, said the driver did not have a passenger in his car at the time. She said:\u00a0'The driver was not on a job - he was heading to go to collect someone. 'He was stopped waiting for pedestrians [to cross in front of him] and while he was stopped someone ripped open the car door - so he was defending himself. 'We\u2019re shocked to hear that an Uber partner driver was attacked in Soho. We are offering our full support to the driver who has gone to the police to report the incident. Thankfully the driver in question, whilst shaken up, is unharmed.' After being thrown to the ground, the man gets to his feet and dusts himself off before kicking the driver . The scuffle happened near Shaftesbury Avenue, known for its theatres, on Monday evening . The video was taken by black cab driver Hassan Mostafa, who was dropping off a passenger nearby at the time. He said: 'I looked and saw the Uber car and a man shouting. I knew something was happening, . 'I started recording and the man came out of the car. Then he and a guy started fighting. 'At that point I had to drive off and later I saw police at the scene.' The Uber driver was called into the firm's London offices on Thursday morning and later went to report the incident to the police. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said they were aware of the video and that officers spoke to two men in the Shaftesbury Avenue area on Monday night. No arrests have been made.",

Thawing relations between the US and Cuban governments could open isolated communities to new economic opportunities once the US fully lifts its ban on trade and travel. It\u2019s in villages such as Gabriel where visitors can experience a side of the Caribbean island that few holidaymakers bother to see. Scroll down for video . People linger outside a residence, where meat is sold at a roadside stand, in the rural village of Gabriel, Cuba . Cuba's rural communities, where there are few jobs, could benefit the most from thawing relations between the US and Cuban governments . Like in Havana, posters or paintings of revolutionary hero Che Guevara are visible everywhere in the village of Gabriel . A salesman waits for customers at his roadside stand, where customers can buy fresh vegetables and fruit from a local farm . In Gabriel, there are very few cars, workers harvest tomatoes by hand, farmers sell produce and meat at roadside stands, goods are transported by horse and buggy or tractor, and \u2013 just like in the capital of Havana \u2013 posters or paintings of revolutionary hero Che Guevara are visible everywhere. While life goes on as normal in 'the real Cuba', talks continue to take place between US and Cuban officials to restore full diplomatic relations and move towards opening trade. The old Cold War foes are claiming progress after a second round of discussions to end a half-century diplomatic freeze. Presidents Barack Obama and Raul Castro have promised to restore embassies in each other\u2019s capitals, although a few hurdles remain, including Cuba\u2019s place on the US state sponsor of terrorism blacklist. Thawing relations between the US and Cuban governments could open isolated communities to new economic opportunities . It is likely that with economic sanctions lifted, Cuba will change forever, and there are fears it will lose some of its unique identity . In Gabriel, Cuba, there are very few cars, workers harvest tomatoes by hand, and goods are transported by horse and buggy or tractor . The US is planning to ease travel and trade restrictions with Cuba, a former Cold War foe, after agreeing to restore ties severed since 1961 . While most US tourists will likely stick to Havana or all-inclusive resorts on the sea once the ban on travel is lifted, rural villages who do welcome foreigners are not prepared to handle them in large numbers. Many lack running water, suitable accommodation and modern facilities, including toilets. With Cuba poised to open itself up to a massive market for holidaymakers, tourists from outside the US are being warned that if they want to see 'the real Cuba' they should book their trips now, before the Caribbean country becomes 'Americanised'. Rural villages are not prepared to handle foreign tourists in large numbers, as there are very few modern facilities . With many issues unresolved, the US is hoping to reach agreement on reopening embassies in time for a regional summit in Panama in April . Some travel experts are encouraging tourists to visit Cuba sooner rather than later if they want to see unadulterated local culture . In rural Cuba, villagers make a living by selling vegetables, fruit and meat from local farms . The number of tourists visiting Havana has seen a steady increase following the normalisation of Cuba-US relations last year . While the landmark thaw in relations signals a positive future for Cuba, travellers looking to explore the 'timewarp' nation are being urged to go before it changes forever. TravelSupermarket travel expert Bob Atkinson recently told MailOnline Travel: 'It really is a unique place to visit, and once it becomes fully open to the Americans, they will without doubt pile in. 'Havana was seen as a party destination for Americans years ago, such was its close proximity to Florida. Presidents Barack Obama and Raul Castro have promised to restore embassies in each other\u2019s capitals, although a few hurdles remain . One of the biggest hurdles is Cuba's place on a US list of state sponsors of terrorism, from which Cuba is pushing to be removed . Tourists on a double-decker bus take in the sights, including a local football match, during a tour of Havana, Cuba's capital . If the US lifts its restrictions on travel and trade, one of the biggest draws for American tourists could be Major League Baseball games . 'However you look at it, opening up to the Americans will change the way it feels and I think this will be to the detriment to the culture and heritage of the place. If restrictions are lifted and Cuba becomes a popular destination for US tourists once again, one of the biggest draws could be the countries\u2019 shared love of baseball. Major League Baseball is considering playing spring exhibition games on the baseball-mad island nation, where American teams played before Fidel Castro came to power. Major league teams regularly held spring training camps in Cuba in the 1940s and \u201850s, and there have been discussions to bring them back to the country once the governments officially end the diplomatic freeze.",

        "document": "Vicarage Road was awash with emotion on Saturday afternoon as Watford performed a show of solidarity for Nic Cruwys, the fan left fighting for his life in hospital. Cruwys was shockingly set upon by a group thugs on his way back to Wolverhampton train station from Molineux last week and is in a critical condition. The 44-year-old had been in the Midlands to watch his side draw 2-2 in the Championship. Watford\u2019s players warmed up with \u2018For Nic\u2019 T-shirts in show of support for injured fan\u00a0Nic Cruwys . Watford performed a show of solidarity for Mr Cruwys, the fan left fighting for his life in hospital . Watford\u2019s players warmed up with t-shirts reading \u2018For Nic\u2019 and the club dedicated their matchday programme to him with the message \u2018thinking of Nic - showing the strength of the Watford FC family\u2019. Members of Nic\u2019s family were given a rousing reception on the pitch before the game against Reading, with all four sides of the stadium on its feet in applause - then mirrored just before the break. A banner behind one goal simply read: \u2018Best wishes Nic \u201cMoo\u201d, we are all thinking of you... From your Watford FC family.\u2019 Two teenagers, 13 and 18, have been arrested and bailed until April after the attack. A heartfelt message of support for Mr Cruwys was displayed on a large banner before the game . Mr Cruwys was in a critical but stable condition at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham on Saturday . Chief executive Scott Duxbury wrote in the programme to address the \u2018horrendous events\u2019 of seven days ago. \u2018Everyone who works for Watford has had Nic Cruwys in their thoughts since last Saturday\u2019s sick and unprovoked attack,\u2019 Duxbury said. \u2018I\u2019d like all Watford fans to be aware just what a positive impact the support you\u2019ve shown towards Nic and his family has had. An online appeal to raise funds to help Mr Cruwys, set up by a Wolves fan, has raised more than \u00a325,000. A fund set up to raise money for the Watford fan has raised more than \u00a325,000 to date . Troy Deeney helped Watford secure a 4-1 victory against Reading on Saturday . \u2018Nic was simply enjoying a day out at an away match with his friends when he suffered a callous, calculated and unprovoked assault. Any one of us coming away from the stadium could have suffered as Nic has. \u2018You\u2019ll no doubt be aware of the online fund set up to benefit Nic and his family. The total raised is now \u00a325,000 and, while money cannot wipe away what has happened, I am aware that the gesture has been extremely well received. \u2018In closing I find it very difficult to come to terms with what has happened. I can only take solace from the fact I know everyone connected with this football club will do everything to help and support Nic.\u2019 Sixteen-year-old Ollie Floyd, a Wolves supporter, whose idea it was to start the fund was interviewed and given a warm reception on the pitch at half-time.

        "document": "So now we know. Not only can Rory McIlroy play golf better than anyone else, he can throw clubs further than anyone else as well. With perhaps the most extraordinary act of frustration we\u2019ve seen on a golf course in recent years, the Northern Irishman left no-one in any doubt as to what he thinks about his current erratic form. After a wild three iron plunged into the water at the par five 8th on Friday, the world No 1 hurled his club 60 or 70 yards into the adjacent hazard. World No 1 Rory McIlroy threw a club into the water in frustration after more erratic play on Friday . McIlroy swings and releases his club after finding the water during\u00a0the WGC-Cadillac Championship . The Northern Irishman watches as his club soars into the air and towards the lake . The 25-year-old's club makes a splash as it lands in the water on Friday afternoon . Maybe when he\u2019s finished breaking golfing records he will take up the javelin. Of course it was conduct terribly unbecoming and will lead to an inevitable fine. But the vast majority of golfers will have recognised what was going on. \u2018It was just heat of the moment stuff and not one of my proudest moments,\u2019 admitted McIlroy. \u2018I\u2019ve never done anything like that before. I probably wouldn\u2019t have done it here but I knew I didn\u2019t need a three iron for the rest of my round. So I thought: \"Yeah, why not?\u201d\u2019 His playing partner knew exactly what was going on. Henrik Stenson is a prince off the golf course but on it the Swede has broken more than his fair share of clubs in anger. \u2018It was an impressive release from Rory,\u2019 he said, smiling. \u2018You know, for a small guy he\u2019s got a strong throw and he had good speed on that one.\u2019 Worried perhaps that one or two of the American press might not get the joke, he added: \u2019Be nice to him. He\u2019s a good guy.\u2019 For those who would rather bounce up and down with righteous indignation, here\u2019s what the great American amateur Bobby Jones said almost 100 years ago: \u2018There are some emotions that simply cannot be endured with a golf club in your hands.\u2019 The game might be unrecognisable from Jones\u2019s day but in that regard it remains the same. Of more concern for McIlroy followers is what it says about his current state of mind. Under Plan A, he\u2019s only got six more competitive rounds at most to play before the Masters, when he will be trying to complete the career grand slam. Clearly, his game is not where he wants it to be but at least he\u2019s not lost his sense of humour. McIlroy takes his tee shot on the seventh hole of the second round in Florida . McIlroy missed the cut in the Honda Classic last week and struggled to an opening 73 at Doral . Asked what will he do for a three iron on Saturday, he replied: \u2018There\u2019s one on the way, but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s courtesy of Nike or a scuba diving team.\u2019 The curious thing was he seemed to play better with 13 clubs than 14. This was McEnroe-esque rather than McIlroy. With the frustration no longer pent-up, he made a birdie with his second ball at the 8th, before birdieing the 10th and 12th holes. Another birdie at the 17th meant he finished with a 70 and, on one under for the event, stands on the fringes of the top ten. \u2018What\u2019s annoying me is there\u2019s no sign on the range of the sort of shot I hit on the 8th,\u2019 he said. \u2018So it\u2019s a little bit of a mental thing and a bit physical and something I need to work on.\u2019 McIlroy is eight shots off the lead held by American JB Holmes, who double-bogeyed his last hole to give everyone a break. He is now just two shots ahead of fellow American Ryan Moore, with Adam Scott lurking in third place, a further shot behind. Then come Stenson and Masters champion Bubba Watson at five adrift. Scott is not only playing his first competitive round for three months, he is also using a short putter in competition for the first time in four years. You could say it is working. So far he has had 30 putts inside 12ft\u2026.and holed 28 of them. Welshman Jamie Donaldson, runner-up in this event last year, is seven behind after a 72. Alongside McIlroy on one under is Lee Westwood, who is playing in his 50th WGC \u2013 the first man to reach that milestone since the four events to enjoy such status were conceived in 1999.",

        "document": "A young Australian woman is spearheading a global campaign petitioning Facebook to remove 'body shaming' emoticons and status options from the social media site. Rebecca Guzelian, along with seven other women around the world, has partnered with Endangered Bodies, an international movement challenging body image standards, to launch a campaign to remove the \u2018I feel fat\u2019 and \u2018I feel ugly\u2019 emoticons from the social media site. Ms Guzelian, a counsellor and intern psychologist, is one of over ten thousand people to back the 'Fat is not a feeling' petition, and claims that the options perpetuate and normalise body shaming, especially in young people. Scroll down for video . Rebecca Guzelian has partnered with Endangered Bodies in the 'Fat is not a feeling' campaign . Ms Guzelian launched the Australian 'Fat is not a feeling' petition and shared her personal experiences . 'When I first heard that the 'fat' and 'ugly' feelings options were made available for people to select on Facebook, I was shocked and definitely felt compelled to work alongside Endangered Bodies to do something about it,' Ms Guzelian told Daily Mail Australia. Endangered Bodies has been petitioning Facebook to remove the options from their site, and has partnered with the women to start national petitions to remove the options from all forms of the website. Women from the UK, Ireland, the US, Germany, Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, and Australia have partnered together to post their personal stories and experience with body shaming to promote the campaign, which has garnered  thousands of signatures in just a few days. Facebook has long held itself up as a community driven social media site, and over the ten years since it's inception, has introduced different features to reflect the habits of the millions of people on the site. The 'fat' and 'ugly' emoticons were first introduced in 2013 as part of the 'feelings' feature for status updates, along with almost 100 other emoticons that can be individualised to reflect a user's mood. Ms Guzelian said the emoticons normalise body shaming and encourages young people to use the words publicly to speak negatively about themselves. 'Encouraging this kind of 'fat talk' is not okay \u2013 and that\u2019s exactly what Facebook is doing by offering these words as options,' Ms Guzelian said. Eight women have partnered with Endangered Bodies, a movement challenging body image standards . The eight women have all started national petitions to remove the options from all forms of the website . Psychologist Sarah McMahon from Endangered Bodies Australia, along with her colleagues from around the world, have been petitioning the social media giant since the status options were introduced but have received no response. 'Facebook has not been listening. Not only do these features remain as emoji selections, Facebook have not addressed the critcisms that this plays in contributing to culture of body shaming,' Ms McMahon said. 'This is despite the fact Facebook claims that one of their core values is to build social value- which in this instance they are not doing. This is particularly concerning when research demonstrates that Facebook use is already associated with increased risk of eating disorders, weight concern and anxiety,' she said. '\"Feeling fat\" was once the language of clinical eating disorders and it is now normative in our society. It is well documented that \"fat talk\", as using such terms is known, perpetuates body image issues and body shame rather than reduce it. Women from the UK, Ireland, the US, Germany, Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, and Australia are campaigners . Endangered Bodies has been petitioning the social media giant since the status options were introduced . Over 10,000 people have signed the 'Fat is not a feeling' petition on Change.org . Ms Guzelian said that she and the other women hope that the social media giant will recognise that the emoticons are contributing to body shaming issues, and that it is a concern for Australians. The petition explains that '\u2018fat\u2019 and \u2018ugly\u2019 are adjectives. They describe physical characteristics, NOT feelings.' 'Having these word choices completely normalises using derogatory descriptive terms in the place of real feelings. What\u2019s worse is that these adjectives are judgemental and forced on us by society to make women (and increasingly men) feel negatively about their otherwise healthy bodies,' the petition says. 'When someone says \u201cI feel fat\u201d what they\u2019re really communicating is that they feel unattractive, unhappy, embarrassed and insecure about their body. And believe it or not, these feelings are most commonly a response to the unrealistic, culturally promoted ideals of thinness and beauty that are shoved in our faces every single day.' Ms Guzelian, who works as a counsellor at The Butterfly Foundation, Australia's leading body supporting people who struggle with eating disorders and body image problems, said that young people are becoming increasingly obsessed with how they look. 'For young people, who are on Facebook from nine, ten, 11 years of age, having a huge platform like this tell them it's normal to speak about themselves like that is a huge issue.' 'Facebook encourages people to focus on and scrutinise the way they look, so as to present the best version of themselves in the online world. Doing this really places an extreme focus on the external, instead of the internal,' she said. The 'fat' and 'ugly' emoticons were first introduced in 2013 as part of the 'feelings' feature for status updates . Ms Guzelian said  that the emoticons are contributing to body shaming issues . The petition explains that '\u2018fat\u2019 and \u2018ugly\u2019 are adjectives. They describe physical characteristics, NOT feelings' 'We begin to measure our worth by the way that we look \u2013 because let\u2019s face it, Facebook isn\u2019t the place that we are all posting about the important reasons why we are great, wonderful valuable and worthy people on the inside.' Ms Guzelian said that the campaign was as much about encouraging a positive discussion about body image as it was a bid to have the emoticons removed. 'There are things everywhere in the world that tells us to be ashamed of how we look, and why we feel bad about ourselves,' she said. 'There are cues everywhere around us, guiding us down that path and if we can prick up our ears and take notice, then we can choose to see ourselves and others in a different light.'

The second in line to the throne found himself in the unusual position of having to paint the eyes on a larger than life sheep - British cartoon character Shaun the Sheep, no less. 'You know I can't do two things at once,' he joked with the photographers who asked him to pose up with his artwork. Scroll down for video . Prince William smiles as he paints the eyes on a Shaun the Sheep model during a ceremony in China . The Prince is on a four-day visit to China with the\u00a0sheep-marking ceremony signalled the launch of the first ever Year of Cultural Exchange between the UK and China . He added approvingly: 'It's not particularly stylish but it will pass.' The sheep-marking ceremony signalled the launch of the first ever Year of Cultural Exchange between the UK and China, a showcase of innovation for British goods and services. In the Chinese calendar this is the Year of the Sheep - and with Aardman Animation's Shaun being the UK's most famous export of the species, the British Council thought it might be fun to marry the two. The ceremony took place in the gardens of the residence of the British Ambassador, Barbara Woodward. William was shown five sculptures of Shaun, each decorated by a different artist, which are among 50 such sculptures to be displayed across China and later auctioned off in aid of the Beijing Cultural Development Fund. In the Chinese calendar this is the Year of the Sheep - and with Aardman Animation's Shaun being the UK's most famous export of species, the British Council thought it might be fun to marry the two . The prince joked with photographers who wanted him to pose and paint the eyes on the sheep, saying\u00a0'You know I can't do two things at once' The prince gamely agreed to finish decorating a particularly patriotic animal, covered in the Union Flag, by painting his eyes. Dotting the eyes of the traditional lions used in Lion Dances is thought to bring good fortune and happiness - and it is hoped that by William doing this he will bring such benefits to the Year of Cultural Exchange. It also ties in with the Chinese idiom 'san yang kai tai',which means 'the advent of Spring brings prosperity'. The prince was accompanied by Sajid Javid, Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, who said: 'We are incredibly proud of our creative industries, they are one of our biggest success stories and a tremendous driver of economic growth. Crowds of people gathered to catch a glimpse of the second in line to the throne during a visitor to the British ambassador's official residence in Beijing . Prince William greets a young baby who was brought to the ceremony. The Duke's visit is the highest-profile visit by a member of the royal family for 30 years . 'The Year of Cultural Exchange will be a wonderful celebration of UK and Chinese creative talent and will help forge new business relations between our two nations. ' Nick Marchand Director of Arts and Creative Industries at the British Embassy said William was a 'fantastic ambassador' for the UK. 'It's wonderful that he can be here to launch this for us,' he said. Earlier William visited Shijia Hutong, an elegantly restored courtyard house, resurrected from dilapidation two years ago with funding from the Prince's Foundation, set up by his father, Prince Charles. Dressed in a smart suit, the prince was greeted by Matthew Hu, China Representative of the Prince's School of traditional arts and Drew Ross, the China MD for the Prince's Foundation. The Duke of Cambridge meets with Chinese children who have physical disabilities on a visit to the Shija Hutong in Beijing . Prince William is guided by Matthew Hu, China's representative of the Prince's School of Traditional Arts after meeting disadvantaged children . The Prince also visited Bejing's Forbidden City where he chatted pleasantly about the weather and remarked on what a nice day it was . Today marks the first of a four day visit to China after the Duke of Cambridge earlier visited Japan . The prince chatted pleasantly about the weather and remarked on what a nice day it was - not realising the air pollution index for Beijing today is 140, nearly six times the WHO recommended maximum. He also met with groups of disadvantaged rural children in urban Beijing. He chatted about the various challenges they face, and was presented with a small hand-drawn picture, drawn by a 10-year old migrant child from poverty stricken Henan province named Wu Qiuyun. The picture shows a collection of little houses surrounded by foliage and prompted William to 'that will look nice in George's bedroom'. He was was also introduced to Zhao Chen, 14, who is effectively blind and, with the assistance of his mother, learning opera singing. Mr Zhao said: 'My dream is to go to your palace to sing opera'. Duke replied: 'Well, you've met the right man. We might be able to arrange something.'",

        "document": "Two New Jersey drug addicts who were arrested last year after the woman's baby nearly died after eating heroin have avoided prison time. Mark Tomat, 26, this week admitted to a judge that he and his girlfriend Tara Bradbury, 23, took heroin at her home in Wyckoff on Valentine's Day 2014. Last month, Bradbury - who comes from an upper-middle class New Jersey community - gave birth to a second child while she was being treated at an intensive program - to ensure she didn't take any more drugs to harm her unborn son. Mark Tomat, 26, admitted to a judge that he and his girlfriend Tara Bradbury, 23, took heroin at her home in Wyckoff last February. Bradbury's nine-month-old baby accidentally ingested the drug . Tomat said he left the narcotic lying around the house and learned Bradbury's baby had ingested the drug about an hour after he left  that night. Police found text messages between the two in which they talked about a plan to deny that they knew the baby had eaten heroin - so as not to incriminate themselves. Paramedics responding to a 911 call found the infant unresponsive and with a bruised forehead. The baby recovered after it was administered Narcan, an antidote for heroin overdose. Bradbury, who is from the upper-middle-class community Indian Hills, was sentenced to drug court, which means she will be provided with ongoing treatment in an intensely supervised drug treatment program. On February 27 she delivered the couple's first child together - her second. Bradbury voluntarily entered Bergen County Jail earlier that month so that she could receive proper medical attention in the weeks leading up to her due date, according to her attorney Joseph Rem. Bradbury, pictured here in 2013, was sentenced to drug court,which means she will be provided with ongoing treatment while being supervised and randomly drug tested. She recently delivered her first child with Tomat . Bradbury, pictured in 2013, voluntarily entered Bergen County Jail earlier that month so that she could receive proper medical attention in the weeks leading up to her due date . Her stay would also protect Bradbury from doing anything that could potentially hurt the fetus, Rem told the\u00a0Cliffview Pilot. Tomat will be sentenced to probation in exchange for his plea. His attorney Warren Sutnick said Tomat has made 'enormous strides' since the incident and that he believes his client will be 'very successful'. When Wyckoff Police Department officers searched Bradbury's home last year, they discovered Suboxone, which is used to treat narcotic addiction, and other drug paraphernalia, according to prosecutor John L. Molinelli. Molinelli said investigators also found deleted text messages from Bradbury and Tomat's cell phones in which the couple allegedly planned to deny that they knew the baby had ingested heroin. The infant is now in the care of relatives. Bradbury's attorney said her stay would also protect Bradbury from doing anything that could potentially hurt the fetus .

        "document": "A trusted church treasurer stole \u00a390,000 to fund her online gambling habit, then pretended to be ill to escape justice. Nicola Holding was described as a 'pillar of the community' for her role at St Boniface's church and pre-school in Plymouth, Devon. But she was secretly siphoning off money from church funds and spending it on herself, Plymouth Crown Court heard. Holding, 50, pleaded guilty to fraud two years ago, but repeatedly failed to turn up to be sentenced, blaming a variety of serious illnesses. Jailed: Nicola Holding has been sentenced to prison for stealing from the church where she was treasurer . Yesterday she was finally sentenced to two and a half years in prison after arriving at court in a wheelchair wrapped in blankets. She whimpered during the hearing with her head slumped to the side, and at one point was given a sugary drink to help her diabetes. Kelly Scrivener, prosecuting, said that Holding had stolen \u00a390,000 between 2008 and 2011, forging documents to cover up the fraud, and had repaid just \u00a324,000. She said \u00a37,700 was paid out to Gala Coral online gambling and \u00a36,700 to Ikea, while Holding had also claimed expenses for her voluntary role helping out at the pre-school. In June 2011, Holding went to Reverend Alison Shaw 'in hysterics' saying she had 'got things in a muddle', the court heard. Judge Paul Darlow said:\u201d 'You plundered their accounts for your own benefit including gambling on internet sites.\u201d' Victims: The congregation at St Boniface's church in Plymouth were betrayed by the fraud, a court heard . He also said that Holding, a divorced mother of two, had falsely claimed to be housebound when she was caught on camera outside her home. Jo Martin, defending, said: \u201c'Since the allegations her fall from grace has been huge and her life has even more spiralled out of control. Undoubtedly she has a number of medical issues.\u201d ' She said Holding would find prison life '\u2018extraordinarily difficult'\u2019 because of her ailments. Ms Shaw, who took in Holding when her marriage broke down, read a statement to the court about the impact of the defendant's crimes. 'It was a huge sense of betrayal which has had a massive impact on the church and the church community,' the vicar said. 'She was central to everything in the church. Young people put her on a pedestal and she preached to the adults. \u201c'She was a very moral person who told them how to behave. Nicola was trusted implicitly.\u201d' Holding was wheeled out of court to begin her sentence at a prison which can cater for her medical condition.",

        "document": "Former England captain Lewis Moody says he does not think England will win the World Cup this year. Moody, who won 71 caps over a 10-year career, believes Stuart Lancaster's team are 'not quite where they need to be' to lift the William Webb Ellis cup on October 31. The former Leicester and Bath flanker, speaking at an awards ceremony for the Prince's Trust in London, told the Press Association: 'I don't think England are in the right place at the moment to win the World Cup. Former England captain Lewis Moody does not think England are in a position to win the World Cup . Moody knows what it takes to win the tournament having lifted the Webb Ellis Cup in 2003 . 'If they can get through the pool stages they'll have a great, fighting chance. Being at home for every match makes a massive difference and if you get into a semi-final anything could happen - but I think at the minute they are probably not quite where they need to be to win the World Cup. 'They can certainly be there to push the others, and if they get into the semi-final then there is every chance they could make the final.' Moody, who cannot see beyond New Zealand as tournament winners, believes Lancaster may be hoping his squad will peak for 2019. He continued: 'He's been building a team, there are a lot of young new changes coming, so I think he'll be focusing on the next World Cup, especially as he's had that nice new contract extension.' However, he believes England can still win the Six Nations. Lancaster oversee training as his side prepare to face Scotland in the Six Nations on Saturday . How England and Scotland will line up for Saturday's Calcutta Cup clash at Twickenham . Moody said: 'It is disappointing that England have ended up in this position. They had a good chance to come away with a Grand Slam but they have got to focus on Scotland now. 'It should be a reasonably comfortable result against Scotland, and then go on and beat France. They can still win it, but it will be a big ask now - we are reliant on other teams.' Moody added: 'I am a huge fan of Stuart Lancaster. 'I think he's done terribly well and I think all that now Stuart is lacking is that win, that result that really says, 'Look, what I've been doing over the last four years has been about this, achieving this', and if we can take something out of the Six Nations, which will be tough now, then he'll have that.' One bonus is that the Six Nations may well have ironed out England's conundrum at fly-half and in the centres, Moody suggested, with George Ford and Jonathan Joseph cementing their places. He said: 'For me it is quite simple. I think Ford has stepped up and done a fantastic job. I'd keep him there, and he would be my man for the World Cup. It will be interesting to see where Owen (Farrell) slots in when he comes back. Moody thinks George Ford has stepped up as England centre and should keep his place for the World Cup . Ford offloads a pass during training as England prepare for Saturday's Six Nations match against Scotland . 'Joseph has stepped in and filled a void I think we've been nursing since Will Greenwood was playing, and that's some time ago now. 'And when Manu Tuilagi comes back I'd like to see Joseph and Tuilagi playing in the centres together and how they can work that. I think (Luther) Burrell has been all right but I think Joseph and Tuilagi are probably the future.' Moody was adamant Ford's rise had not consigned Farrell's days as England's starting number 10 to history. 'They are certainly not over,' he said. 'The fact George has come in and done so well, George Ford has had a fantastic start to his international career. 'Owen is a young man in his own right. Those two vied for the under 20s spots, they were centre and fly-half together when they played England under 20s together, so they know each other well. 'Owen is a great temperament and he'll work hard to make sure he is pushing George all the way for that 10 shirt.'",

        "document": "Dentists are profiting from a huge rise in cosmetic treatment as more of us spend thousands of pounds to get a winning smile. The top-earning private dentists in the UK made a collective turnover of almost \u00a31billion in 2014 \u2013 up 22 per cent on 2010 \u2013 with treatments including \u2018smile analyses\u2019 and sonic polishing, research shows. Analysis by finance provider LDF says the rise is because Britons are shelling out thousands of pounds for private treatment. One of the increasingly popular procedures is so-called smile analysis, when a dentist assesses the width of the mouth, its symmetry and the extent to which teeth are even and white. Dentists are profiting from a huge rise in cosmetic treatment as more of us spend thousands of pounds to get a winning smile . The process typically costs \u00a3100. But any subsequent treatment such as braces, crowns being fitted on uneven teeth or whitening can be up to \u00a310,000 depending on what a patient decided to have done. Other procedures include sonic clean and polishing \u2013 for about \u00a3130 a session \u2013 which uses air and tiny particles to blast teeth and remove stains caused by coffee, chocolate and wine. Some private dentists have renamed their surgeries \u2018spas\u2019, greeting patients with scented candles in the waiting room and offering facials, foot massages and aromatherapy. Separate figures from the British Association of Cosmetic Dentistry estimate the number of people seeking such treatments is growing by 40 per cent a year. Experts say adults are becoming more self-conscious and worry that their personal life and career may be hindered if they don\u2019t have nice teeth. Britons are shelling out thousands of pounds for private dental treatment . Also, medical advances have replaced traditional train-track braces with clear, barely noticeable devices costing \u00a36,000. Many are having these fitted in the run-up to major events where they will be extensively photographed such as family weddings or milestone birthdays. Peter Alderson, of LDF, said: \u2018British people have taken to cosmetic dentistry in a big way, and that\u2019s reflected in rising incomes for top dentists. \u2018Increasing numbers of dental patients are starting to explore cosmetic treatments like laser whitening, and are willing to pay significant amounts of money for cutting-edge services, especially if they are delivered in a more exclusive, private clinic-style environment. \u2018The biggest dental groups are able to invest very heavily in their practices\u2019 equipment, furnishings and IT systems, and that has raised the stakes in the profession markedly. The younger generation of dental clients \u2013 those that are more comfortable with paying for cosmetic dentistry \u2013 expects enhanced services such as online booking and text message reminders as well as cutting-edge treatments. \u2018If dentists want to make the most of the demand for cosmetic dentistry, they need the type of apparatus and environment that brings in clients, but that type of equipment routinely costs tens of thousands of pounds.\u2019 One popular procedure is \u2018cosmetic bonding\u2019, in which grey fillings or chipped teeth are painted over to make them almost invisible, costing up to \u00a31,000. Laser whitening is increasingly being offered for about \u00a3100. Nissit Patel, of Progressive Dentistry in Putney, south-west London, said: \u2018Over the past five years, I have seen a huge increase in adult orthodontics, primarily for cosmetic reasons. In my practice, the business has at least doubled in the past three years.\u2019 He added that many of his patients came to him shortly before weddings or birthdays.",

If scheduled executions this Wednesday and the next go forward, the state will have completely exhausted its supply of pentobarbital. \"We're exploring all options,\" said Jason Clark, spokesman for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, \" including the continued use of pentobarbital or an alternate drug(s) in the lethal injection process.\" In recent years, states across the country have struggled to maintain a supply of lethal injection drugs as manufacturers either stopped producing the drugs or barred their use in executions. The European manufacturers of pentobarbital, an anesthetic, explicitly banned U.S. prisons from using its drug in executions. Tennessee has said it will electrocute inmates if it can't get the drugs it needs. Other states have sought out substitutes or gone with one drug instead of the traditional three-drug cocktail. In April, Oklahoma used midazolam as a substitute for pentobarbital as part of a three-drug cocktail in an execution that went awry. Clayton Lockett, a convicted rapist and murderer, writhed and convulsed after the drugs were administered. It took 43 minutes for him to die. Texas gets its pentobarbital from compounding pharmacies, which are not subject to Food and Drug Administration oversight, something opponents of the death penalty have decried.

The youngster had endured such a miserable upbringing that he told his foster carer that 'Santa' had stopped coming to visit his house, even though he had 'been good'. Today, as his mother and her partner were spared jail for child cruelty, images from inside the family's council house in York reveal the 'unimaginable filth' in which the child was forced to live. Squalor: These horrific images show the squalid conditions inside a fly-infested, dirt-ridden home where a five year-old boy was neglected so badly that he did not know what a bath was for . 'Unimaginable filth': Police found piled-up dirty crockery and rotten food strewn across the  house in York . 'Unkempt': The council house's lounge contained a double bed that was covered in dog hair, dirt and clothes . Rubbish and rotting food can be seen littered around the filthy home, while every work surface in the kitchen is covered in dirty crockery or moldy food. Amid a stench of rotten food wafting through the property, there was also an abundance of insects and flies which swamped the tiny, cramped rooms. Shockingly, dog faeces, dog hair and clothing were also found strewn across the house, including on the carpet, the doors and even on a double bed, which had been set up in the living room. Among the chaos was a filthy mug, with the words 'top daddy' ironically emblazoned across the front. Authorities had been alerted to the boy's plight after he escaped from the house and his frantic mother, who cannot be named for legal reasons, rang the police. He was later found a mile from his council house in York and told police he had 'woken up and looked around the house and nobody was home'. York Crown Court had heard how police then visited the house and found it in unimaginable filth with every surfaced piled high with dirty dishes. Filthy: Officers discovered the mess after the boy\u00a0escaped from the house and his mother, who cannot be named for legal reasons, rang the police.

It emerged that foster carers had found several of his baby teeth had their roots exposed with abscesses while six had to be removed. There was no toothbrush suitable for his use in his house. Prosecutor Aisha Wadoodi said: 'Every work surface in the kitchen was covered in dirty crockery and rotting food. There was only rotting food in the fridge. 'The floor was covered in dog hair and clothing. The back yard was covered in dog excrement. The lounge contained a double bed that was covered in dog hair and dirt. 'The property was very dirty and unkempt. There was an odour of stale and rotting food and a lot of insects and flies flying about everywhere.' She said it later emerged the little boy didn not know what a bath was for or how to be washed. The boy's 43-year-old mother (left) and her partner, 42, (right), whose faces have been obscured by MailOnline for legal reasons, were spared jail despite admitting two charges of child cruelty . 'Very serious neglect': There was also said to be a stench of stale, rotten food, wafting through the home . Concerns: Sentencing, the judge said he had 'grave concerns' about the couple's failure to accept help . Ms Wadoodi added: 'The foster carer reported that when she first gave him a bath he seemed very frightened and she also observed that he had wax coming out of his ears. 'He showed considerable discomfort while eating. He told his foster carer that Santa doesn't come to his house.' The court heard how the boy's school contacted the mother in 2013 expressing concerns about his hygiene and tiredness. Although this temporarily improved, the court heard how his hygiene then spiralled again towards the end of the academic year. The prosecutor added that, months down the line, his foster mother now describes the child as 'a lovely little boy, very chatty, open and likes to please people'. Grime: This close-up picture of the kitchen shows rust, dirt and grease lining the appliances . Victoria Smith-Swain, for the 43 year-old mother, said she had a long history of depression which she described as 'forty years of baggage surrounding her childhood'. The woman and her 42-year-old partner admitted two charges of child cruelty but were spared jailed. Sentencing them at Leeds Crown Court, Judge Rodney Jameson QC described the case as 'very unhappy' and involved 'very serious' child neglect. He said: 'It is almost inconceivable you let yourself and your child live in this squalor without some psychiatric difficulty. 'You knew the problems that you had and were offered help but didn't take it. 'I have grave concerns about your failure to accept help. I find this a very worrying aspect of the case.' The mother was handed a 18-month prison sentence suspended for two years,\u00a0while her partner was jailed for six months, also suspended for two years. The couple were also ordered to carry out 120 hours of unpaid work.",

The one-bedroom flat in Rothesay on the Isle of Bute, valued at \u00a320,000, is coming up for auction at the end of the month, making it almost certainly the cheapest flat in Britain. Seller Catherine Scott, 58, said: \u2018It was my late husband\u2019s property and we are looking for a quick sale. Scroll down for video . Location, location, location: This one-bed flat on the holiday island of Bute, Scotland, is coming up for auction for just \u00a31, despite being valued at around \u00a320,000 . Seller Catherine Scott, 58, said the flat belonged to her late husband and the family chose the low asking price because they are looking for 'a quick sale' \u2018It has been in his family for a long time, but it is a lovely flat and would make someone a very nice little holiday home.\u2019 The sandstone property is in Rothesay town centre, close to the 13th century castle and a five-minute walk from the harbour \u2013 although it does not offer sea views. Auction House Scotland will put the property under the hammer in Glasgow at 2pm on March 26. The company\u2019s website describes the auction sale as \u2018an excellent opportunity to purchase a Scottish holiday home or a buy-to-let investment for only \u00a31\u2019. Auction House Scotland says the property has\u00a0a large lounge, kitchen, shower room and bedroom, with gas central heating and double-glazed windows . The town of\u00a0Rothesay, where the property is located, is close to a 13th century castle and a five minute walk from the harbour which has ferries to\u00a0Wemyss Bay .

Gillian Cochrane of Auction House Scotland said: \u2018We\u2019re expecting a big turnout, there\u2019s been a lot of interest so far. It was our idea to put the guide price at \u00a31. \u2018The reason we did that is, firstly, you get a lot of interest; and secondly, the sellers just want a fast and final sale. Market experts believed the flat could be rented out for around \u00a3364 per month, or could provide a nice holiday home for whoever snaps it up . Auctioneers say the guide price of just \u00a31 has attracted a lot of interest so far, and they are expecting the property to be snapped up quickly on March 26 . \u2018When the hammer falls, it\u2019s a done deal. Whereas if you are buying from an estate agent, it can drag on \u2013 about 30 per cent of estate agent deals fall through . \u2018The flat can be a place you can go to for a short break, or you can rent it out.\u2019 Market experts said the flat could be rented out at \u00a3364 per month.",

        "document": "Paddy McNair admits he will fulfil his boyhood dream if he earns his first Northern Ireland cap against Scotland on Wednesday night. The Manchester United defender has been given his first taste of top-team action at Old Trafford by new boss Louis van Gaal this season. Now he is set to follow that up by making his international debut in Glasgow when Michael O'Neill's side take on the Scots at Hampden Park. Paddy McNair has made an impressive breakthrough for Manchester United this season at the back . The 19-year-old was forced to pull out of his first involvement with the national team last October due to injury, while he was an unused substitute a month later as the Irish lost 2-0 away to Romania. But he is expected to finally pull on the green jersey in the midweek friendly clash that will serve as a warm-up ahead of Sunday's crucial Euro 2016 qualifier with Finland at Windsor Park. 'It would be a dream come true if that happens,' said the teenage centre-half. 'As a young boy it is a dream to play for your country. 'I went to a few Northern Ireland games when I was very young but I don't remember too much about them. I can remember the atmosphere and hoping that one day I would be out there as well, so if I can do that on Wednesday I will be very proud.' The Northern Irishman competes with the Premier League's newest star Harry Kane at White Hart Lane . Wednesday's match will be just as important to the Scots as it is O'Neill's troops as both countries look to end their long absences from major tournaments by claiming a slot at next year's European Championships in France. While Northern Ireland are just a point off the summit of Group F after taking nine points from the first 12 available, Gordon Strachan's side are very much in the hunt themselves. They sit third in Group D, three points behind leaders Poland and level on seven with Germany and the Republic of Ireland. With that in mind, McNair does not expect an easy introduction to the international game. 'It's going to be tough,' he said. 'It's a game against another home nation and both teams want to win. It won't be a friendly. The 19-year-old has seen his game time limited in recent weeks but has done enough to earn a call-up . 'It's a game we can definitely win, though. We showed in the games in the qualifying group we can beat anybody. 'Scotland have some very good players. I've played against Steven Naismith earlier on this season and you can see why people rate him so highly.' McNair can also expect to come up against another familiar face clad in Dark Blue, with former United midfielder Darren Fletcher likely to line-up for the hosts. The 31-year-old - who quit the Red Devils in January after 12 years to sign for West Brom - played an influential dressing-room role while McNair was making his way through the Old Trafford ranks. Darren Fletcher (right) was influential in helping McNair settle into the United dressing room before he left . And the youngster happily admits he owes the four-time Premier League winner a huge debt of gratitude. 'Darren really helped me a lot and have to thank him a lot for that,' said McNair. 'When I first broke into the team he gave me a lot of advice and really did help me settle in. 'When you come through at Manchester United, it is such a big club with so much pressure on you. 'Darren was in the same position I'm in now at one stage so he would often come up to me before games and have a word to make sure my head was on right. 'Darren is a great player and I'm very happy to see him back playing regularly with West Brom.' Louis van Gaal took a risk on McNair when he had a shortage of defenders and was rewarded for his trust . In the 13 games McNair has racked for Van Gaal's side this term, he has done enough to leave the Dutchman so impressed that he reckons the Ballyclare youth could be a mainstay of the United line-up for the next decade. But McNair himself is trying not to look too far ahead. He said: 'I don't think I will really realise how good a season I have had until the end of the season when I look back at it, but so far I'm very happy. 'Am I surprised at how quickly things have gone this year? Yeah a little bit. 'Sometimes you just need a bit of luck to get your chance. But I was confident that once I got my chance I could take it.'",

        "document": "From treacherous road conditions to soggy jeans and frizzy hair - nobody enjoys cycling in the rain. But now there\u2019s an \u2018umbrella\u2019 for bikes that\u2019s designed to keep riders dry as they cycle along. The Leafxpro clip-on windshield, claims to enable cyclists to ride their bikes comfortably in the most miserable conditions, including rain, snow and gusty winds. Scroll down for video . The Leafxpro clip-on windshield (the basic version is illustrated), is designed to that cyclists can ride their bikes comfortably in the most miserable conditions, including rain, snow and gusty winds . Portuguese engineer and cycling enthusiast Manuel Brito, who came up with the idea, said the Leafxpro can withstand crosswinds of more than 50mph (80kph) because of its aerodynamic shape. \u2018Leafxpro is aerodynamically designed to reduce air resistance and can be used in even the most demanding conditions,\u2019 he said. The shield (pictured) is aerodynamically designed to reduce air resistance so it can be used in windy weather . \u2018The resistance results showed that the kits can be used also in tougher conditions such as mountain biking as well.\u2019 The plastic windshield will stop rain blowing into the face of a cyclist, and it shouldn\u2019t steam up, like other more enclosed canopies. The device is designed to be fitted to any style of bike and can be packed away into a small bag when the weather improves, in just one minute. The kit weighs around 2.2lbs (1kg). It\u2019s available to pre-order from Kickstarter in four models - Classic, Advanced, Storm and Family. Prices range from \u00a399 ($152) for the basic model to \u00a3199 (\u00a3305) for the family kit which also protects a child on a rear bike seat. Mr Brito, 40, said: \u2018The idea of Leafxpro arose because we love cycling and it\u2019s disappointing to have to use polluting means of transport just because of the bad weather. \u2018We started thinking that there had to be an efficient, versatile and comfortable solution that would provide a sense of freedom for all people who love cycling.\u2019 It has taken him years to design and test the product, which is a modular structure that adapts to different weather conditions. The canopy is \u00a0available to pre-order from Kickstarter in four models - Classic, Advanced, Storm and Family (pictured) .Prices range from \u00a399 ($152) for the basic model to \u00a3199 ($305) for the family kit which also protects a child on a rear bike seat . The device, which is designed to stop oncoming rain and keep a cyclist\u2019s head and back dry, is designed to be fitted to any style of bike and can be packed away into a small bag when the weather improves. This image shows an illustration of the family version . \u2018The Classic model, designed for episodes of snow, cold and light rain, turns easily into the Advanced or Storm models simply by sliding fasteners to join the modules,\u2019 he explained. \u2018LeafXPro kits are designed for the urban cyclist, for anyone who commutes to work by bicycle, for parents wanting to cycle their kids to school or people who want to enjoy bike tours as a tourist during sightseeing.\u2019 \u2018The Classic model, designed for episodes of snow, cold and light rain, turns easily into the Advanced or Storm models simply by sliding fasteners to join the modules,' Mr Brito said. The storm version covers a rider's head more as well as their arms . Last summer, a firm in Delft, the Netherlands, invented a simple clamp that fixes to a bike's handlebars to hold a windproof umbrella. The holder can also be used to store the umbrella when the rain stops too. The umbrella's asymmetric design is said to help it withstand high speed wind gusts of up to 70mph (113kph), because wind is directed over and around it. While its makers, Senz, cautions against riding in high winds, the umbrella design lends itself to coping with the air stream created by cycling. The clamp costs \u20ac39 (\u00a331) while the umbrellas come in different sizes and are sold separately for \u20ac25 (\u00a320) and \u20ac50 (\u00a340).",

        "document": "This is the moment a playful young seal tries its best to hitch a ride with a couple of kayaks - but keeps sliding off. The grey seal pup was filmed as it made several attempts to climb aboard the canoes in Poole Bay, Dorset. At first the adorable seal tries his best to jump on both the kayaks, but he keeps sliding off, back into the water. Hitching a ride: Ron the friendly seal attempts to climb onto a kayak in Poole Bay, Dorset . Attempt one: The young pup makes it onto one of the kayaks, and momentarily keeps his balance . He then manages to get onto the left kayak, but just as it looks like he has found himself a comfortable spot - he falls in again. The pup, known locally as Ron the Seal, \u00a0finally succeeds by draping himself across both of the kayaks. Kayaker Andrew Linstead shot the video of the young seal's repeated attempts to climb aboard his raft as he paddled in Poole Bay. This is the third time Mr Linstead has had an encounter with Ron the Seal in four months. Last November, while Mr Linstead was practicing rolling his kayak in the water, he noticed the seal watching him and then joining in, rolling every time he did. Fail: Unfortunately for Ron the Seal, he cannot manage to stay on the kayak, and falls back in the water . On it again: Ron the seal proves he is not a quitter and is soon at it again, trying to climb the kayaks . A month later, the pair met again, as Ron jumped on the back of his kayak and hitched a ride around for several hours. The latest encounter, filmed by Mr Linstead, lasted for four hours with Ron climbing on and off Mr Linstead's kayak and even bringing him a fish it had caught. Mr Linstead, from London, said: 'I've had quite a few encounters with Ron now, we are becoming good friends! 'The first time I saw him was when I was practising rolling my kayak. Ron seemed to roll whenever I rolled my kayak. 'Afterwards I put a message on a Facebook local community page asking if anyone knew anything about the seal and I got lots of responses. The locals have called it Ron, as in Ronseal. 'I think when Ron now sees me he feels comfortable. 'This time I was out on my own and I saw another kayaker. I asked him if he could brace or roll his kayak in case Ron got on his boat and tipped up over. Resting spot:\u00a0Kayaker Andrew Linstead shot the video of the young seal's repeated attempts to climb aboard his raft as he paddled in Poole Bay . New buddies: Their encounter lasted for four hours with Ron climbing on and off Mr Linstead's kayak and even bringing him a fish it had caught . Another ride: This is the third time Ron and Mr Linstead, from London, has met in four months . 'He said he couldn't so he came alongside me and held on to my kayak. 'I don't think he believed me that Ron would come over but he did. 'Ron tried to climb on but he kept slipping off. It went on for hours, I took my last shot of him about four hours later. 'I've spoken to other kayakers in the area and they say they have never seen anything like that.' Julie Hatcher, from Dorset Wildlife Trust, said: 'This is a young grey seal. Seals tend to be a bit wary of people, we don't know why this one isn't. It might just be a personality thing. 'They are solitary animals when they are at sea. They come together for breeding but generally are solitary in the water. 'Young ones tend to be more friendly and playful. I have dived with seals and the young ones will come near you, they can be quite curious and like playing hide and seek, but the adults don't tend to.' The waters of the UK are home to more than 180,000 grey seals, which is more than a third of the world's population.",

        "document": "Just as I can't travel to Liverpool without thinking of The Beatles, so I can't travel to Los Angeles without thinking of The Beach Boys. Their songs of beaches, baggies, boards and bikinis painted a picture of a sun-kissed paradise, and their voices sounded as bright and as laid-back as California itself. This time I was travelling specifically to discover the people and places that inspired the band. I started in Hawthorne where the three Wilson brothers - Brian, Carl and Dennis - were raised, and joined up with guitarist Al Jardine and vocalist Mike Love to form a group. The Beach Boys were famously non-surfers but that didn't stop them tapping into the sun, sea and sand culture of the Golden State . The Wilson family home on 119th Street, where the boys taped their first single Surfin' in 1961, was demolished to make way for Interstate 105. The rest of the street remains though, its neat lawns, porches and fluttering flags reminders of the group's clean-cut All-American origins. A redbrick memorial now stands at the site of the Wilson house, with a bas-relief frieze showing the group carrying a surfboard and a plaque noting that the music conceived here 'broadcast to the world an image of LA as a place of sun, surf and romance'. Hawthorne is indeed a place of sun (263 days a year) but no surf and little romance. It's a charmless city that expanded on the back of the post-war aviation industry (Los Angeles International is only five miles away). I could see why the teenagers of the 1950s would get 'bugged' driving 'up and down the same old strip'. Hawthorne Boulevard, with its low-rise jewellery shops and furniture stores, is no place for the young. The Pizza Show (13344 Hawthorne) added a splash of colour when it arrived in 1956 and became a home from home for the fledgling Beach Boys. Now run by the son of the original owner, it retains its kitsch medieval Italian interior, with wrought iron chandeliers, tiled awnings and mock grilled windows. Surfin' safari: The town of Huntington Beach, where the surf is year round, is known as Surf City USA . Foster's Freeze (11969 Hawthorne), another gathering place, is a blue-roofed fast-food outlet that offers FOOD from one service hatch and ICE CREAM from another. When I arrived Louie Louie, a 1963 hit by The Kingsmen, was playing over speakers in the overhang. This was the very 'hamburger stand' where Brian Wilson saw a girl pull up in her father's Thunderbird and had the inspiration for Fun Fun Fun. Hawthorne High School, around the corner on El Segundo Boulevard, is where the Wilson boys and Jardine attended. The Beach Boys came back to play the 1969 prom and honoured the institution in their song Be True to Your School. The nearest surfing beach to Hawthorne is Manhattan, but the best is Huntington Beach, better known as Surf City USA. Here the sand is soft, the surf is year-round, and the broad beaches stretch for more than eight miles. The broad beaches of Huntington stretch for more than eight miles . Other than Dennis Wilson, The Beach Boys were famously non-surfers, but they were smart enough to observe the burgeoning oceanside culture and knew there was mileage in chronicling it. They mentioned Huntington Beach in Surfin' Safari. The city of Huntington Beach makes much of its surfers. There's a Walk of Fame, a Hall of Fame and a small International Surfing Museum. The sports shops sell everything from boards and wetsuits to sunglasses, caps and jeans. My hotel, the Waterfront Beach Resort had a surfboard in the foyer and doorknob signs that read Wiped Out rather than Do Not Disturb. Huntington Beach is better known as Surf City USA - where the fantastic surf is year-round . It was cold and overcast on my first morning but by 8.30am there were already more than 100 surfer bobbing about in the ocean. From the the pierI could watch them mounting their boards and waiting patiently to ride in on the most powerful of the tall, grey waves. As if on cue, a local surf music tribute band, The Breakaways, dressed in faded blue denims and short-sleeved Hawaiian shirts, began playing at the pier entrance. An even better insight into surf culture and music came a few days later when\u00a0The Surfaris drummer David Raven took me to an outdoor gig in Irvine, Orange County, where he played with bassist Jay Truax (ex-Nomads), and guitarists Ron Eglit (Dick Dale and his Band) and Paul Johnson (The Bel-Airs). They called themselves The Legends Surf Band. We picked up Johnson from his apartment. He was wearing a baseball cap, blue jeans and sandals and had a black patch over his left eye. On the drive down he told me his story. As a 15-year old schoolboy in 1961 he'd composed a hit tune called Mr Moto for The Bel-Airs. Orange County, just south of LA, has its own strong surf culture such as at Newport Beach . That summer, when playing at the Knights of Columbus Hall in Redondo Beach, a leading surfer came over to him and said: 'Wow, man! Your music sounds just like it feels out on a wave. You should call it surf music.' So he did. When The Beach Boys adopted this sound the hard-core sports crowd initially shunned them. 'As long as they posed as surfers they were resented by those in the true beach culture,' Johnson told me. 'But when they went on to celebrate California youth culture at large by singing about cars and cruising, that broadened their appeal.\u00a0After that, even surfers appreciated them.' When The Beach Boys started recording their focus shifted from Hawthorne to Hollywood. They signed with Capitol Records, whose 13-storey circular tower at 1750 Vine Street, built in 1956, has become an LA landmark. Legend has it that the architecture was based on the image of a bunch of singles stacked on the spindle of a record player. The night I visited, Arcade Fire were playing a promotional set on a specially built platform outside the tower. The Beach Boys' earliest albums were recorded at Capitol but by the time of Surfer Girl and Little Deuce Coupe, they were also recording around the corner at United and Western (6050 Sunset Boulevard). At the Petersen Automotive Museum there are plenty of cars from the era The Beach Boys celebrated . Now called Ocean Way Studios, this is where they recorded their 2012 comeback album That's Why God Made The Radio. In 1965, Brian Wilson bought the then modern 1448 Laurel Way in Beverly Hills with its great views over the LA basin. It was here that he notoriously built himself a huge sandbox in the living room to stimulate his creative juices. (The video for Sloop John B was filmed in the garden pool.) Two years later he moved to 10452 Bellagio Road in the more upmarket gated community of Bel Air. Several Beach Boys' albums, including Smiley Smile, Wild Honey, 20/20 and Surf's Up, were partially recorded here, while Charles Manson, a fringe figure on the LA music scene in 1969, visited to tape songs that he'd written. In songs such as Little Deuce Coupe, Shut Down, Little Honda, and Fun Fun Fun, The Beach Boys explored the parallel teenage subculture of cruising and hot-rodding. Illegal street racing still takes place but usually in the early hours of the morning, and it's a crime even to be a spectator. In 1967 Brian Wilsonmoved to a more upmarket gated community in the exclusive area of Bel Air . Custom car shows tend to happen out in the desert rather than in the city. But at the Petersen Automotive Museum (6060 Wilshire Boulevard) it's possible to see everything from hot rods and deuce coupes to Thunderbirds and Chevrolets. Spread over two spacious floors, there are plenty of cars from the era The Beach Boys celebrated - a peach-coloured 1957 Lincoln Premiere once owned by Jayne Mansfield, a black 1957 Chrysler, and a wonderful boat-sized 1959 red Cadillac Convertible. The hot rod section has a classic Deuce Coupe customised from a 1932 Ford. Appropriately the museum cafe, Johnny Rockets, is a 50s-style diner with red plastic seating, chrome surfaces and neon signs. On my final day I headed north on the Pacific Coast Highway to Malibu. There's probably no road that better embraces the geographical joys of LA - steep hills and canyons to one side, broad beaches and ocean to the other - and no drive is better suited to a Beach Boys' soundtrack. The group even recorded a song about it in 2012. Beyond Malibu lies Paradise Cove. A left-hand turn took me a mile down a hill to a private beach edged with cliffs where the group was photographed for the cover of 1962's Surfin' Safari, and again two years later for All Summer Long. Paradise Cove is not really a top surf destination despite all the surfboard-shaped signs . Paradise Cove is now home to one of the world's most luxurious trailer parks. Film directors, screenwriters, models and Hollywood actors such as Minnie Driver and Matthew McConaughey have swapped bricks and mortar for transportable homes with a view. A surfboard-shaped sign ironically declared No Surfboards. The warning was somewhat redundant as beaches can be private but the sea is free and, anyway, the waves are so mild that no serious surfer would choose it. Maybe that's why The Beach Boys came here - and why they kept their shirts and jeans on during the shoot.

        "document": "A regional benefits cap, taxes on disability benefits and a limit on child benefit to the first two children could be introduced in a new welfare squeeze after the general election. Leaked Whitehall documents show officials have drawn up a series of options that could be used to further reduce the benefits bill. All the main parties are committed to money-saving welfare reform, but the Conservatives have pledged to make the deepest cuts, taking \u00a312billion out of welfare in the next Parliament. A regional benefits cap, taxes on disability benefits and a limit on child benefit to the first two children could be introduced in a new welfare squeeze . A two-year freeze on some benefits and a lowering of the new benefits cap \u2013 the maximum amount in benefits a household can receive \u2013 from \u00a326,000 to \u00a323,000 are already on the agenda. The Institute for Fiscal Studies suggests those measures would save \u00a32billion a year by 2017-18. But documents leaked to the BBC also suggested a regional benefits cap, an idea backed by Labour, as one possibility. The \u00a323,000 limit would vary across the country, with the highest sum paid in London, where housing costs are greatest. It is said that limiting child benefit to the first two children for future claimants would save \u00a31billion a year. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said the proposals were not Tory party policy . The documents also proposed taxing disability benefits \u2013 a move that would prove highly controversial. This would mean better-off claimants losing some of their payments, and would save \u00a31.5billion a year. Carer\u2019s allowance could be restricted to the most needy, saving \u00a31billion. And the contributory element of employment and support allowance and jobseekers\u2019 allowance would be reined in. Currently claimants who have paid enough National Insurance contributions can get the benefits with little means-testing. Some 30 per cent of claimants, over 300,000 families, would lose about \u00a380 per week, saving taxpayers \u00a31.3billion. Council tax support, meanwhile, could be incorporated into the new universal credit, which is gradually replacing all the main out-of-work benefits and tax credits. And replacing the industrial injuries compensation scheme with an insurance policy for employees would save \u00a31billion. The Tories insisted that the proposals were not party policy and had been prepared by officials considering all options for the next government, of whatever make-up. \u2018It\u2019s wrong to suggest that any of this is part of our plan,\u2019 said a spokesman for Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith. Labour Work and Pensions spokesman Rachel Reeves, said: \u2018These plans were drawn up for Conservative ministers to deliver their extreme cuts plan.

        "document": "Doctors  stress the importance of detecting disease early on to give people the best chance of recovery. And in the very near future you could get these early warning signs using just your smartphone. A San Francisco firm has developed a sensor that identifies gases and molecules released in a person\u2019s breath that could hint at an underlying illness. Doctor in a stick? The very early model of the sensor (pictured) has been created by San Francisco-based BoydSense and is on display at this year\u2019s Mobile World Congress in Barcelona . Advanced software and prediction algorithms are then used with a connected app to reveal any anomalies. The very early model of the sensor has been created by San Francisco-based BoydSense and is on display at this year\u2019s Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. Endogenous volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are released either through everyday metabolic activity, or by diseases in the body. Once created, they travel into the blood and are released in urine or breath. In addition to detecting volatile compounds in the breath, the firm said the sensor could be used to identify compounds released by rotting food . Some compounds, including carbon for instance, are released naturally. BoydSense has therefore developed software that can identify at which point the level of a gas or compound is beyond what is considered normal. It uses predictive algorithms to then convert the data so that patients and doctors can understand what the results mean. It is hoped that complex processing will prevent needless worry or give a false reading that suggests they are ill. If the sensor is added to a smartphone, for example, a patient could record their breath and the results could be sent to their doctor automatically. In particular, the sensors build on current breath gas analysers that are used to detect early signs of diabetes and even lung cancer. In addition to detecting volatile compounds in the breath, Mr Thuillier said the sensor could be used to identify compounds released by rotting food. In the MailOnline demo, the BoydSense sensor was able to detect an orange within 30 seconds . BoydSense\u2019s boss Bruno Thuillier gave MailOnline a demo of the technology at Mobile World Congress. The current sensor is a prototype and syncs with a smartphone via Bluetooth - although Mr Thuillier hopes future models will be embedded into the phones themselves. It takes around a minute to normalise and stabilise, a process needed to ensure that any readings are not contaminated by previous \u2018sniffs\u2019. This process is expected to be much faster on a finalised version, however. For the demo, the sensor is then placed inside a jar containing molecules released by oranges. Within about 30 seconds the sensor beeped to say it had recognised the molecules and a picture of an orange appeared on the connected smartphone. This was a simplified way of demonstrating its capabilities, but Mr Thuillier explained that the compounds released by oranges and vanilla - another jar in the demo - were complex enough to show its potential. If attached to a smartphone, the sensor could be placed in a fridge or cupboard and detect if chicken is nearing its best-before date, or if fruit and vegetables are about to turn. Mr Thuillier said: \u2018I am excited to help lead in the creation of the first multi-bio sensing platform that detects and analyses biosignatures anywhere, anytime. This platform will improve the way consumers manage their wellness. BoydSense aims to be the world leader in solutions and services that enable and transform the way people gather and manage their biosignature analytics.\u2019",

        "document": "For most boys, China would seem the ideal place to go to school. Just days after football was officially added to the national curriculum in a bid to win the World Cup, the country's air force has announced plans for Top Gun-style training for pupils as young as 14 to develop tomorrow's fighter pilots. A total of 16 senior high schools have been enlisted as 'Air Force Teenager Aviation Schools', according to the\u00a0People's Daily Online. Sky-high dreams: A team of 77 pilots aged 18 and over recently took to the skies for the first time in a five-hour flight training demonstration at one of the air force's existing junior flying schools . Aspiring face: These teenage pilots have been trained by elite from Chinese Air Force while maintaining academic studies - as the new younger recruits will be . Off you fly: Each student conducted two flights, logging around 80 minutes of time in the air . The news came as China's air force released pictures of its current intake of 18-year-old trainee pilots being taught at its junior flying school. The new 'Top Gun' schools that will give training to boys aged 14 and up will be located in 15 cities across China, including regional capitals like Wuhan and Changsha, and will be chosen based on their previous performance and the level of support they are able to get from local government. The judging body is formed by representatives from the Ministry of Education of China, the General Political Department and Air Force. All schools are regular senior high schools that offer mainstream academic courses. Cream of the crop: The students were selected from senior high schools around the country . Learn to fly: The students have to complete 18 hours' training in basic aviation theory as well as 28 hours of pre-flight study and one hour in a flight simulator . Lead the world: Officials from the Air Force said China had decided to step up its game because major powers in the world all invest heavily in training pilots from young ages . We want you: The poster of China's Teenage Aviation School programme . Special 'Aviation Experimental Classes' will be set up in these Teenage Aviation Schools, which plan to recruit 1,000 students every year. A class is usually made up by 30 to 50 students in China. This means there will be approximately 20 to 30 teen pilots classes every year. These classes are jointly managed by the schools and Air Force recruiting authorities. Male teenagers between 14 and 16 years old from all over China can apply before September 1, the start of an academic year in China. Once accepted, successful candidates will be given meal and living allowances, a rare exception for students in China. Scholarships will also be offered to the cream of the crop. These teen pilots will be taught under the programme for three years before entering the University Entrance Examination in China for a chance to further their studies in aviation universities in the country. While news about Teenager Aviation School has just been released, People's Daily Online published a gallery of a team of trained Chinese teen pilots taking to the skies. These 77 students, who are aged around 18, were selected from senior high schools around the country to receive Air Force training at junior flying schools. Start them young: The country is endeavouring to provide pilot training among young male pupils in senior high schools . Large-scale recruitment: Besides specialised air force schools, regular senior high schools are to set up experimental classes to train young pilots . In their first public flying demonstration recently, these teen pilots carried out five hours of real-equipment flight training. The training took place at a air base in Changchun, provincial capital of Jilin in northeast China. Shi Yansong, one of the teen pilots, said though their training followed a quasi military standard, he felt he still had much to learn from their commanders who were Air Force elite. Unprecedented showcase: This was the first time China had arranged real flight training for teen pilots . Ready for take-off: Shi Yansong, one of the teen pilots in the flying training, said it was his dream to become a pilot in the future . Air base: The training took place in Changchun in northeast China . 'Flying a jet feels so amazing,' said Shi, 'I must become a real pilot in the future.' As China's first batch of training pilots who maintain regular academic studies, the teenagers' flying debut is a landmark on the history of China's teenage aviation education, commented People's Daily Online. Peng Junxia, head of China's Air Force recruiting bureau, told Chinese media that the junior flying schools were established because major powers in the world all invest heavily in training pilots from young ages. In addition, China hopes such schools can raise a large number of outstanding Air Force commanders in the years to come. Big occasion: Students and trainers take part in the ribbon-cutting ceremony at the military training demonstration . Military vs academic: Unlike regular air force members who often give up academic study for military training, these teen pilots are taught by top faculty in China .",

        "document": "(CNN)Sen. Rand Paul, who is expected to announce on April 7 that he will be running for the presidency, is garnering a great deal of attention as he travels around the country promoting his brand of libertarian conservatism. The Kentucky senator's widely publicized appearance this month at the South by Southwest festival at Austin, Texas, was one opportunity he used to appeal to a tech-savvy audience. His particular blend of ideas -- a combination of libertarianism and Republican conservatism -- stands out from the rest of the pack. Younger Republicans, the much-desired millennial vote, seem attracted by what they are hearing. What accounts for his appeal? In an era when so many Americans seem frustrated with shallow, personality-based politics, there seems to be genuine interest in a candidate who is fighting for a set of ideas. For many disaffected younger Republicans, Paul offers a version of the conservative agenda that seems foreign to the modern GOP. For almost half a century, \"big government conservatism\" has ruled the party. Although conservatism is theoretically about limited government, the historical reality has been much different. On national defense, the hawks of the GOP have been victorious. Even while railing against the dangers of a big federal government, Republicans have lined up to support higher defense spending and a massive military-industrial complex. Though the GOP has little tolerance for many social safety net programs, the party has accepted sizable government support to industry, such as the financial bailout known as TARP in 2008 and subsidies for certain economic interests. Paul has been a vocal critic of the neoconservative turn that the GOP has embraced in recent decades, during which the party moved beyond support for high national security spending and toward a bolder vision of aggressive nation-building and regime change. For some Republicans, including Paul, these policies were at the heart of the failures of George W. Bush's presidency and a sharp departure from the party's principles. Similarly, Paul has been one of the few Republican voices to argue that post 9/11 surveillance policies have dangerously curtailed civil liberties. At the local level, he has criticized the militarization of police forces and the treatment of African Americans by law enforcement officers. Paul has also backed away from some tenets of social conservatism that don't sit well with a growing number of Republican voters. He has been an outspoken advocate of giving states the right to legalize marijuana. He has been attuned to the ways in which younger generations of Republicans are not on board with the evangelical fervor of the 1970s conservative movement and want to move in a different direction. While many Republicans have talked about the need for their party to tackle issues involving race and inequality in ways that are different from Democrats, most have been unwilling to offer any substantive ideas. Indeed, the recent budget blueprint from congressional Republicans exposed how thin discussions of a Republican anti-poverty program are. Their budget centers around cuts to key social safety net programs such as Medicare and regressive supply side tax cuts. But Paul, who has appeared to be supportive of a stringent budget, has also been willing to put forward bolder ideas, including criminal justice reform, that deal directly with the conditions that have devastated African American communities. Can Paul really win? That is unclear. Republican strategist Matthew Dowd told The New York Times: \"It's one thing to be interesting; it's another thing to be compelling. They've got to see him sitting in the Oval Office. And I do not think Rand has crossed that threshold yet.\" There are many skeptics who don't think that he has what it takes and that he has a controversial record. Paul's extremely critical remarks about key aspects of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 will certainly come back to bite him, as will some of his blistering attacks on the Federal Reserve. Paul is also trying to make the case for a libertarian conservatism that is not pure. Paul is still a Republican, so he will continue to fit his ideas within the broader agenda of the GOP. He is also a politician at heart and will make compromises that he believes are essential to survive. While Paul argues that he is trying to take some of the ideas that libertarians liked about his father and make them politically viable, some of his supporters smell a sellout. Arguably, we have seen this recently when he signed the controversial letter to Iran led by Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas (a neoconservative mentored by the hawkish Bill Kristol), switched his approach to the issue of same-sex marriage and gave support to an aggressive war against ISIS. \"This is more than a flip-flop. This is a backflip,\" the editor of an anti-war website told the Daily Beast. \"This was the last straw. I've put up with a lot from that guy! I've had to defend him like a Jesuit. I'm done. Let somebody else do it.\" But if Rand Paul can sell primary voters that his blend of ideas still offers something distinct from the rest of the Republican candidates, at a minimum he can help reshape the debate within the GOP by raising questions about some of the party's core positions.",

        "document": "Dili, East Timor (CNN)Stacey Addison, who says she was detained for months in East Timor because she unwittingly shared a taxi with a stranger carrying methamphetamine, is headed home. Addison boarded a plane Tuesday on the first leg of her journey back to Oregon. \"I am thrilled to report that Dr. Stacey Addison has gotten her passport back, and is now on a plane returning home here to Oregon,\" Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Oregon) said. \"This is terrific news for Stacey, for her family, and for all the Oregonians who have followed Stacey's story and helped support her from afar,\" Merkley said in a statement. Addison, 41, was detained in September in the small Southeast Asian nation in a drug case in which she says she's innocent. She was released in December but she still couldn't leave because her passport -- seized during the investigation -- had not been returned. Former East Timorese President and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Jose Ramos-Horta, hosted her temporarily at his home. Addison's arrest in September was an unexpected bump in what had been a multi-year trip around the world. She said she had been traveling solo since January 2013, having quit her job as a veterinarian to explore the globe. On September 5, she was sharing a cab from near the Indonesian border to the East Timor capital of Dili. On the way, a fellow passenger asked to stop to pick up a package at a DHL office, her mother, Bernadette Kero of Oregon, has told CNN. After the man picked up the package, police surrounded the car and arrested the occupants, according to Kero. The package was found to contain methamphetamine, Addison has said. She initially was held for four nights, and a judge released her -- but prevented her from leaving the country while the case was still being investigated -- after the man testified that he didn't know her, Kero said. In late October, during a court appearance where she thought she'd retrieve her passport, a judge ordered her arrest again and sent her to Gleno prison outside Dili. Paul Remedios, a lawyer representing Addison, said at the time that the court detained her again because there was a warrant for her arrest, and that the reason for the warrant was unclear. Kero told CNN in November that the case was a \"nightmare.\" Journalist Wayne Lovell in Dili and CNN's Greg Morrison from Atlanta. CNN's Kristina Sgueglia in New York and Jason Hanna in Atlanta also contributed.",

But the 40-year-old who is widely regarded as the greatest jockey of all time will still end of the season as champion for the 20th consecutive time. An emotional McCoy admitted after jump racing's biggest meet that the Cheltenham Festival will never be the same for him again. After receiving a special presentation in the winner's enclosure, he said: 'It's disappointing that I won't ever be riding at the Festival again. 'That's something I never wanted to think would happen. It was not something I was ever going to look forward to, that's for sure. It's going to be very different when I come back here next year. 'There'll be some sadness when I do come back not as a jockey, but I love a sport that's been very good to me... Cheltenham is an amazing place with amazing people.'

He's a horse that likes good ground and  he doesn't like it when it turns into a drag . 'It was an unbelievable performance from a novice chaser. He got them at it early and stuck at it well.' 'This is something I'm really going to miss,' added McCoy who was given a reception fit for a champion after the last race at Cheltenham. Just as in the previous three days, the Northern Irishman who has stood head and shoulders above the competition for 20 years was saluted before and after every race. But on his this chilly and damp afternoon, the man who has ridden over 4,300 winners finished 'unplaced' on his Gold Cup hope Carlingford Lough.

He said: 'It's probably just now that it's hit me that I won't be riding at the Festival ever again. That's quite tough.' McCoy will bow out with 31 Cheltenham Festival winners to his name, the first coming in 1996 and his final one on Thursday with a fine ride on Uxizandre in the Ryanair Chase.

        "document": "Timeshare fraudsters duped thousands of British victims out of more than \u00a34million a year in a well-honed criminal operation smashed by Spanish police. Police chiefs today announced that they have arrested 56 people - all Brits, including the three alleged leaders - and uncovered 500 mostly pensioner victims. And they said they feared thousands more would now be identified following a series of Costa del Sol raids against the gang which had been operating for more than five years. Detectives detailed the lengths the fraudsters went to dupe victims into handing over cash at a press conference in Malaga this morning. The three-tier scam involved calls from fake lawyers and court officials who persuaded their victims to hand over up to \u00a335,000 after being conned into selling their timeshares. Scroll down for video . Hotspot: The alleged ringleaders, who have not been named, are suspected of laundering the multi-million pound proceeds of their fraud through bars and restaurants on the Costa del Sol (pictured) The chief alleged ringleader, a Brit living in the resort of Mijas, had three homes and a boat and drove two luxury cars he is thought to have bought with his ill-gotten gains. Nearly 80 bank accounts linked to the gang have been frozen and six vehicles seized along with the boat and properties valued at nearly \u00a3600,000. Lead investigator, Inspector Mercedes Perez Quesada, said: 'The fraud was three-fold. 'Telesales operators contacted potential victims and offered them attractive prices to sell their timeshare properties and took advantage of their ignorance of Spanish law once they'd been tempted to instruct them to pay things like administrative or public notary fees. 'Any excuse to get money out of them was valid. 'Once victims had been conned and knew they were never going to get their money back, a second group of people would call claiming to be lawyers saying they were going to launch a group action on behalf of victims and asking once again for money upfront. 'The third tier involved people posing as court officials ringing victims and saying cases had been resolved in their favour but they had to pay fees so they could obtain their cash settlements. 'The scam sounds very crude but we estimate the fraudsters were making between \u00a335 and \u00a335,000 from victims and the fraud was netting between \u00a33.5 million and \u00a34.5 million a year. 'The telesales operators were at the bottom rung of the fraud but knew exactly what was going on. 'The next level up were front men paid to open bank accounts so it made it more difficult to find out where the money had gone. 'They would receive commissions on the transfers of up to \u00a3360...Money collectors working for the three alleged ringleaders would collect up to \u00a32,150 from each front man on a daily basis and pass it on to their paymasters. 'The leaders were the brains behind the operation and the final recipients of the money... They started the operation we have smashed in 2009. Concern:\u00a0Police fear there may be thousands more victims may be identified following a series of raids on the Costa del Sol (pictured) against the gang which had been operating for more than five years . The alleged ringleaders, who have not been named, are suspected of laundering the multi-million pound proceeds of their fraud through bars and restaurants on the Costa del Sol. Much of the money had been banked in offshore accounts. Two of the three alleged leaders were arrested along with 36 other suspects in raids in February during the first phase of the operation. The man police say is the ringleader was detained in a second phase after returning to Spain from the UK. A judge at a court in the Costa del Sol resort of Fuengirola is now coordinating an ongoing criminal investigation. He is probing 11 companies believed to have been set up to facilitate the fraud. Two men including the alleged ringleader have been remanded in jail after a closed court hearing and the remainder released on bail. None of the suspects have been formally charged as is customary under Spanish law, but are being probed on suspicion of money laundering, fraud and membership of a criminal gang. Inspector Perez said: 'We know so far this organisation defrauded 500 British victims out of money but we expect there are thousands of victims.' Police also admitted the alleged ringleader had been arrested before for similar offences. They were not able to say whether he had been convicted in court. Malaga police chief Pedro Garijo Torres said: 'We don't want to comment on things that escape our control. 'The important thing for us was the police operation which is of huge significance in an area like Malaga whose economy relies so heavily on tourism and foreign visitors.' Government spokesman for the area Jorge Hernandez Mollar described the police operation, involving financial crime specialists from Madrid and Malaga, as 'brilliant.'",

After his first call-up to the England squad, he scored his first Premier League hat-trick in Tottenham's thrilling 4-3 win over Leicester on Saturday. The treble took Kane's goal tally for the season to 29 and, with 19 of those coming in the league, he has soared above Diego Costa and Sergio Aguero to top the English scoring charts. The 21-year-old's record compares very favourably with his striking colleagues across Europe too, with Kane now fourth on the list of goal-grabbers in the top five leagues.

Taking only league goals into account, Barcelona superstar Lionel Messi leads the way with 32 goals in 27 matches - that equates to a remarkable ratio of a goal every 74.5 minutes. However, Cristiano Ronaldo trumps Messi on those measures, with a minutes per goal ratio of 71.4 minutes and an average of 1.25 goals per game. He has, though, scored just the 30 goals. The only other player to have scored more league goals than Kane is Lyon's Alexandre Lacazette, with 23 in 26 matches. Kane now has a superior minutes per goal ratio to both Costa at Chelsea and Aguero at Manchester City. He is also outperforming Barcelona's Brazilian superstar Neymar and PSG's hero Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who both have 17 league goals this term. Lionel Messi celebrates yet another goal as Barcelona defeat Eibar in La Liga . Cristiano Ronaldo has scored an incredible 30 league goals in 24 matches for Real Madrid this season . Lyon striker Alexandre Lacazette is third on the list of goalscorers with 23 this season . Kane is outperforming the Paris Saint-Germain forward Zlatan Ibrahimovic this season . Alan Shearer says the uncapped striker should start for England in their upcoming games . Former England striker Alan Shearer has backed Kane to make an impression in the England team, starting with this Friday's Euro 2016 qualifier with Lithuania and the friendly with Italy on March 31. Shearer said on Match of the Day: 'Well considering he didn't start playing regular Premier league football until November he is now top scorer in the league with 19 goals. I think Roy Hodgson should start him. Yes, he's in the squad but start him in the team. 'He's (Hodgson's) watched him enough times this season, he knows what he is all about an he is on fire. 'The form he is in, I think get him in there and he will score goals. He will be a great foil for [Wayne] Rooney and I am a big fan of his.'",

        "document": "Former England spinner Graeme Swann has called on the England and Wales Cricket Board to realise their approach is 'out of date', saying that there is a 'stubbornness' about their selection policy and that they are 'living in the past'. Swann watched on as England slumped to another heavy World Cup loss, with Sri Lanka chasing down their 309 for six with ease, winning with nine wickets and 16 balls to spare. The defeat goes alongside reverses against Australia and New Zealand, with Scotland the only team England have beaten so far. VIDEO Scroll down to watch\u00a0Cricket World Cup Highlights: England vs Sri Lanka . Former England spinner Graeme Swann (pictured in 2013) has hit out at the England and Wales Cricket Board . Wins over Afghanistan and Bangladesh would take them to the quarter-finals, but Swann thinks the problems are evident. Writing on Twitter, he said: 'A positive thing that can come of this world cup is that maybe the top brass will realise just how out of date our approach is.' Swann also aired his views on BBC Radio 5 Live, adding that England had been overly pleased to get what he considered to be an average score. 'I think the problem lies not just with the bowling but the whole approach. It was a very self-congratulatory 310, everyone was saying 'brilliant'. These days that's about average and not a great score,' he said. 'We should be looking for 340, 350; The difference between the top teams and everyone else is immense. They're saying the is the limit when you bat, we're still looking at par scores.' Swann feels the answer could lie with former Nottinghamshire team-mate Alex Hales. 'There's a bit of stubbornness about the selection policy,' he added. 'I like Gary Ballance, he's a great lad, but I think even he'd admit that he shouldn't be in the team at the minute, he's in horrible form. 'We have a lad in Alex Hales, one of these new generation players who does go out and knock it about, he tries to smash everything for four and six. 'We need to get these young lads playing. We have too many people running it, too many people involved, too many plans and I think we're just living in the past.'

Former England captain Michael Vaughan added: 'We are watching a era of Cricket where if you are predictable you will end up with a predictable outcome.' Another ex-England player, Geoffrey Boycott, said the England team were not being realistic. Boycott has long spoken his mind about the national team's woes, and though he conceded to some positives, he sees plenty of work to be done. He told BBC 5 Live: 'I do think we could have got another 20-odd runs, there was a period where we were just cantering around. We are not a force to be reckoned with at all. 'The batting was quite good, but the bowling? No, no, sorry. It wasn't very challenging. 'They're not bad players, we don't have a bad side at all. But we're not firing on all cylinders in any department whatsoever. 'The sad thing for me, even Joe Root, (he gave) a nice interview, lovely lad, but there's no realism. They keep telling us 'we'll take the positives, we did well, we did this'. 'They are trying to tell us little things and we don't see them. They think ex-players like us are just watching to criticise, we're not, we want you to win. 'But we can only tell you what we see and you keep losing.' Opinions also reigned in from other nations, with ex-Australia spinner Shane Warne saying on Twitter: 'Broad & Anderson are averaging 80 with the ball you can't defend any total, also lacking fire power with bat.'

        "document": "Former head of Knox Grammar Ian Paterson has denied touching a young woman's bottom during a school musical to the cheering of young boys, as he admitted deliberately hindering a 1996 investigation into child sex abuse. In the second shocking day of evidence at the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sex Abuse, Dr Paterson said he did 'absolutely not' touch Lucy Perry, who was 15-years-old, during a rehearsal of 'Guys and Dolls' in 1989. 'They were roaring their approval for her performance as the sultry dancer,' Dr Paterson told the inquiry, under intense questioning from counsel assisting the commission David Lloyd. Dr Ian Paterson, the former headmaster of Knox Grammar, has provided evidence to the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sex Abuse for two days . Lucy Perry, the CEO of an international women's charity, told the commission on Monday that Dr Paterson had touched her behind during a rehearsal of Guys and Dolls. She said the action was greeted by a 'roar of approval' from young men in the crowd . Lucy Perry was surprised by the reaction her testimony triggered from victims attending the inquiry, with many standing up to applaud her as she left . In explosive testimony on Wednesday, Dr Paterson also accepted he had hindered a police investigation of claims into child sex abuse led by Inspector Elizabeth Cullen in 1996. Ian Paterson said on Wednesday that when a police inspector from the child protection unit approached him in 1996 about six teachers at Knox about whom there had been complaints, he did not give her full information. In reply to David Lloyd counsel advising the royal commission, which is inquiring into Knox's handling of sex abuse complaints, Dr Paterson agreed he knew this would impede the investigation. Ms Perry, 41, now the CEO of an international women's charity, told the commission on Monday that Dr Paterson, the show's producer, had singled her out during the joint rehearsal between Knox and Roseville College. As she walked to the edge of the stage 'he placed his hand on my backside'. 'I would describe it as between a pat and a grope,' Ms Perry told the commission. 'He then slid his hand right down to cup my buttocks and (I) felt him touch my genitals outside of my clothing.' Ms Perry continued: 'I was humiliated in front of the boys and I heard the boys cheering. 'I was disgusted with Paterson's behaviour and thought he was demonstrating to the Knox boys that it was perfectly acceptable, even admirable, to be disrespectful to girls.' Ms Perry was not interested in pressing charges against Dr Paterson but changed her mind in 2009. 'I wanted to let police know that I was happy to provide a statement if it was going to be useful to demonstrate the culture of disrespect engendered by the school and to highlight the environment and attitudes fostered by the headmaster,' she said. Knox Grammar former headmaster Ian Paterson said on Tuesday that he is 'deeply and profoundly sorry' for failing to recognise and respond to child sex abuse perpetrated while he was head of the school . Dr Paterson also said it never occurred to him to contact police after a balaclava-clad 'intruder' broke into a boarding house and sexually assaulted a Year 8 student . An arrest warrant has been issued for former Knox teacher Christopher Fotis after he failed to appear at a royal commission hearing last Tuesday . His testimony followed a day of evidence on Tuesday where it emerged Dr Paterson allowed teachers he knew had abused children to stay on staff for years. Others he suspected of sexually abusing students were allowed to\u00a0resign and Dr Paterson wrote them positive letters of recommendation following their departures. The hearing on Tuesday also heard that the student files of abuse victims went missing from the school, and no detailed records of sex abuse allegations relating to teachers and students were recorded in their files. Dr Paterson said Knox conducted a number of internal investigations into abuse suffered by students without reporting the cases the authorities, but repeatedly denied that incidences were kept from police or DOCs to protect the school's reputation. He said he made the decision not to sack one teacher who watched hardcore pornography with students in 1987 because the man had 'made a very silly mistake' and had 'enormous potential in the profession'. In a case involving another teacher in 1987, Dr Paterson said he sent a 15-year-old student to the library to 'think about what he said' after the teen confided in him about being abused - describing the student as a 'dramatical boy' who 'liked to exaggerate stories'. Dr Paterson also said it never occurred to him to contact police after a balaclava-clad 'intruder' broke into a boarding house and sexually assaulted a Year 8 student in 1988. He added that he did not think to report the matter to police even after he formed a suspicion the attack was perpetrated by a staff member. On Tuesday, Dr Paterson was questioned about former teacher Craig Treloar who worked at the school until 2009 despite Dr Paterson being aware of the pornography incident that occurred in 1987. Treloar was convicted of child sex abuse in 2010 and sentenced to jail for two years. Dr Paterson said former Knox general duties master Stuart Pearson called him late in 1987 and told him Treloar had shown pornography to a young student. He said he had not asked any further details, including how many boys were shown the tape, how often it had occurred or if he'd propositioned any boys. The hearing continues through Wednesday. Purple ribbons were tied out the front of Knox Grammar School in honour of victims of paedophile teachers . Dr Paterson read out a statement apologising for his failings at the beginning of the commission's hearing in Sydney today . Ms Perry, who heads Hamlin Fistula Ethiopia, told the commission former headmaster Ian Paterson groped her .

Ibrahimovic scored twice on Sunday but it was not enough to prevent PSG suffering a 3-2 defeat and they trail Lyon by two points at the top of the Ligue 1 table. As he walked off the field Ibrahimovic - no stranger to making controversial remarks - was filmed seemingly making derogatory comments about the referee and France as a country. Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored twice but could not prevent PSG's 3-2 defeat by Bordeaux . Ibrahimovic was heard swearing as he walks towards the changing room after PSG's defeat . THe Swede reacted angrily to the defeat and said it was the worst refereeing display he'd ever seen . The PSG talisman reportedly referred to French referee\u00a0Lionel Jaffredo (centre) as an 'a******' after the game . Speaking in English but in partial sentences, the Sweden striker can be heard saying: 'He's an a******. Play 15 years, never seen referee this s*** country. Don't even deserve PSG should be in this country. F****** too good for all of you. Should be happy they exist.' An LFP statement on Monday read: 'Following the receipt of the officials' report, the disciplinary commission of the LFP will study in its meeting of Thursday March 19 the comments made by Zlatan Ibrahimovic at the end of the game between Girondins de Bordeaux and Paris St Germain (29th round of Ligue 1).' French sports minister Patrick Kanner called on the Swede to apologise, telling him 'disappointment did not justify his offensive comments'. He later called Ibrahimovic a 'great champion' after the player wrote on his Instagram account: 'Regarding my comments after tonight's game; they were not against France or the French people. Ibrahimovic looks generally unimpressed as his side fall to defeat that leaves them second in Ligue 1 .

I lost the game, I accept that but I can't accept when the referee doesn't follow the rules. It's not the first time and I'm sick of it. 'My sincere apologies if anyone was offended or took it the wrong way.' Ibrahimovic's anger was sparked when no free-kick was given after Bordeaux goalkeeper Cedric Carrasso picked up a clear backpass from defender Ludovic Sane with five minutes remaining. The outburst comes less than a week after he accused Chelsea's players of acting like 'babies' after he was sent off in his side's Champions League victory over the Blues.

        "document": "Businesses attacked Labour last night over plans to force companies to share profits with employees. Senior party figures are said to be considering a proposal to oblige all firms with more than 50 staff to set up a profit-sharing scheme. Workers would then be handed a regular cash sum based on their employers' financial position. Senior\u00a0business leaders\u00a0have lined up to predict that Ed Miliband is a potential 'catastrophe' for the country . Labour last night said the idea was not official policy, although a shadow minister said it was being considered at the top of the party. But senior business leaders warned the plan would encourage employers not to take on staff. It is the latest in a string of damaging clashes between Labour and business leaders \u2013 who have lined up to predict that Ed Miliband is a potential 'catastrophe' for the country. Glen Cooper, chief executive of Midlands bollard makers ATG Access, said: 'We need Britain's small companies to grow bigger, not be stifled by Labour's meddling. 'This idea will make companies stop taking on employees rather than grow. I am happy to run my own scheme to motivate my employees, but I don't want to be dictated to by Labour.' The Labour policy would mirror the situation in economically feeble France, where companies with more than 50 employees have extra obligations, such as the establishment of a workers' council. It has been reported that such burdens are costing 140,000 jobs, and President Francois Hollande wants to repeal them. Charlie Bradshaw, managing director of Matrix APA, a product design company with 60 staff, said: 'Forcing companies to share profits when they hit 50 employees, just as France seeks to repeal similar laws, will threaten jobs' Simon Walker, of the Institute Of Directors, said: 'We cannot believe that the Labour leader will take such an obviously counterproductive measure seriously. 'Employee profit sharing can work well for companies who choose it, but it has to be up to them. This idea would give companies with 49 employees a very strong incentive not to grow. 'The French government is actually attempting to reduce the bureaucracy that kicks in at 50 workers because they know it is damaging job creation.' Mr Thomas, chairman of the Co-op party, said the policy was being considered at the highest levels . Charlie Bradshaw, managing director of Matrix APA, a product design company with 60 staff, said: 'Forcing companies to share profits when they hit 50 employees, just as France seeks to repeal similar laws, will threaten jobs. 'Small companies should be run by the people who know their culture and staff best, not by central government.' There are around 36,000 companies with 50 or more employees in Britain, employing a total of 12.9million. It means the suggested legislation would therefore affect about 53 per cent of those employed in the UK. It is being championed by Gareth Thomas, a shadow minister and has been adopted by the affiliated Co-operative Party, represented in Parliament by 31 Labour MPs \u2013 including Ed Balls. Mr Thomas, chairman of the Co-op party, said the policy was being considered at the highest levels. He added: 'Hard work too often doesn't lead to higher wages for the working majority, but simply gets funnelled into greater rewards for those at the very top.' A Labour source insisted last night the idea was not party policy. Tory MP Julian Smith said: 'This is another policy that will kill off jobs. Every Labour government in history has left unemployment higher.' Mr Miliband has proposed a series of ideas which have infuriated business groups \u2013 including an energy price freeze and plans for more paternity leave. Bosses have also been riled by Labour's anti-business rhetoric.",

        "document": "All foreign nurses, midwives and dentists will have to pass tough new English language checks before being allowed to treat patients in the UK. NHS trusts will be required to check the language competency of all their healthcare workers, before they are given licence to practise in the UK. The move marks an extension of legislation introduced early last year, which demands that all foreign doctors are now subjected to tough language checks before treating patients. Since the new law was passed 429 doctors have been refused a licence to practise medicine in the UK because their English language skills are not up to scratch. Until now only nurses, midwives and dentists from outside the EU were subject to any language competency tests. All foreign nurses, midwives and dentists will be required to pass English language competency tests before treating patients in the UK after MPs voted to extend legislation introduced last year for all foreign doctors . But today MPs voted to extend the rules to cover those from member states. Today health minister Dr Dan Poulter said voting to include all healthcare professionals, as well as doctors, would offer 'better protection for patients'. Debating the final stage of the legislation, he said: 'We all value the contribution that doctors, nurses and healthcare professionals from all over the world make to our NHS, but being able to speak and communicate to a good standard of English is essential to provide high quality and safe patient care. 'These new laws will provide protection for patients and the public.' Currently the Nursing and Midwifery Council is only required to test the language skills of those nurses and midwives coming to work in the UK from outside the EU. Those moving from member states are permitted to begin work without taking a language test. The NMC said there are currently 26,474 nurses and midwives from the EU on their register, while another 66,163 are from non-European Economic Area countries. There are a total of 685,262 nurses and midwives on the register. Under the new powers if an applicant cannot provide evidence of their language competency, the NMC will be able to ask them to take an internationally recognised test. The NMC's new powers are expected to come into effect later this year. A change in the law, which was passed for doctors last year, came after German doctor Daniel Ubani killed his patient David Gray, when he confused two drugs and gave Mr Gray an overdose . Until last year when the law changed, the General Medical Council only had the powers to test the language skills of foreign doctors from outside the EU. Since 1983, the doctors' regulatory body had been banned from testing the skills of those arriving from EU countries. Last year's change in law for doctors was prompted by an 'alarming' number of cases where patients complained about poor treatment from doctors with a poor grasp of the English language. In 2008 German doctor, Dr Daniel Ubani killed his patient David Gray, when he confused two drugs. As a result Dr Ubani, who was working his first shift in the UK providing out-of-hours cover, injected Mr Gray with 10 times the recommended dose of diamorphine. An inquest later found he was unfamiliar with the drug and had poor English. The Nigerian-born medic was struck off by the General Medical Council but was able to continue working in his adopted country of Germany after the authorities there let him off with a nine-month suspended prison sentence and a small fine. In addition, an alarming 66 cases were investigated by senior NHS staff in 2011 after patients complained of inadequate treatment, citing language difficulties. In an attempt to tackle the problem, the Government proposed changing the law in September 2013. The language tests were to be introduced for the first time, for doctors arriving from the EU. Health minister, Dr Poulter added: 'As a practising NHS doctor, I know the importance of good communication skills to ensure the very best patient care. 'And I have seen first hand when poor communication has let down patients. 'As a minister, I am pleased to be using my front line healthcare experience to give our healthcare regulators these important new language testing powers, which will benefit and protect patients and the public.' The bodies that regulate nurses, midwives, dentists and pharmacists will be given the same powers as the GMC. The GMC now has the power to investigate any complaints made about doctors' poor language skills. And as part of their regular appraisals, and the new medical revalidation process for doctors, which they must pass to continue treating patients, the GMC now checks language skills of those medics from overseas.",
        "summary": "All healthcare workers from the EU will now have to undergo language test .\nLast year Government passed new law to make all foreign doctors take test .\nPreviously only those from outside the EU had to prove competency .\nBut in interests of patient safety, GMC can now investigate doctors' English .\nSince law passed 429 doctors have been refused licence to treat patients .\nToday MPs have voted to extend the law to cover nurses and midwives .\nPharmacists, dentists and other healthcare workers will also take tests .\nMarks first time those from EU will have to take language competency tests .",

        "document": "The new Republican governor of Illinois has said New Jersey is 'going down the drain' - despite it being run by fellow Republican Chris Christie, who sent $7million his way in the latest election campaign. Bruce Rauner said the Garden State was 'lost', thanks in part to its high property taxes. Rauner hit out at New Jersey, which has had Christie as governor since 2010, during a speech at the Illinois Farm Bureau last week. Sniping: Bruce Rauner, right, has said that New Jersey, the state run by his ally Chris Christie, left, is 'a disaster' because of its tax regime . Rauner's backer: Christie's Republican Governors Association gave $7million to Rauner's campaign in the 2014 governor elections . He said: 'We've got the highest property taxes in America other than New Jersey. I don't want to compete with New Jersey on anything, especially that. That's a disaster.' The State Register-Journal of Springfield, Illinois, reported that he continued: 'New Jersey is lost. They're going down the drain, and they ain't turning it around.' The staunch criticism may come as a surprise to Christie, who as the head of the Republican Governors Association funneled $7million in campaign funds to help him topple Democratic incumbent Pat Quinn. Christie often showed up on the campaign trail alongside Rauner, and boasted that he 'didn't come empty-handed' after making a $2.5million top-up to the coffers. He's behind you: Rauner, left, stands behind Christie during a Chicago fundraiser in which the two ate jumbo hotdogs . CBS Chicago\u00a0reported how during the campaign Rauner and Christie made a public appearance to order jumbo hotdogs together before a hotel fundraiser. In return, Rauner has often been a vocal Christie fan. NJ.com reports that he has described him as 'one of the greatest public servants in America today' and 'a superstar'. Rauner spent a total of $37million on TV ads alone in the campaign, in which he outspent Quinn by some $9million, according to the\u00a0Center for Public Integrity. The\u00a0Center's records from the 2014 governor elections show Christie's association sent a total of $7million Rauner's way. Spokesmen for Christie and Rauner have yet to comment.",

The British team showed their strength on the final climb of the Croix de Chaubouret and the pair punched the air after both making valuable moves towards the yellow jersey. The pack had already thinned out considerably when Welshman Thomas made his big move with three kilometres to go of the longest stage of the race. It was a Team Sky one-two on the fourth stage of Paris-Nice secured by\u00a0Richie Porte and Geraint Thomas . Australian Porte then kicked away one kilometre from the finish and it was only Thomas who was able to go with him. Michal Kwiatkowski was third, eight seconds adrift, and that was enough for the Pole to reclaim the overall race lead by a single second, with Porte now next in line and Thomas another two seconds behind in third. Porte, the race winner in 2013, told the Team Sky website: 'That was a great performance from the team. We took it on from the bottom of that last climb. It wasn't easy on there, so to finish first and second is fantastic. Porte celebrates on the podium after winning the fourth stage, and he is now eyeing another overall win . 'We've got two more hard days coming up now and then a time trial on the Col d'Eze. I love that climb and I'd love to have a good ride there. I'm in a good position and having such a strong team here will definitely help. 'With Geraint and I up there on the general classification now, it's good to have two cards to play.

        "document": "A man who survived a suicide leap from the Golden Gate Bridge has told in detail how he was saved by a sea lion which kept him afloat until the coastguard arrived. Kevin Hines is now a global speaker on mental health issues and shared his remarkable story at a suicide prevention conference in New South Wales, Australia. Aged just 21, he was suffering from bipolar disorder and psychosis when he jumped from the San Francisco landmark on a chilly September day in 2000. Scroll down for video . Emotional: Mental health campaigner Kevin Hines told a conference yesterday how he survived a suicide attempt nearly 15 years ago - because a sea lion circled under him and kept him afloat until help arrived . Although he lived, Mr Hines almost lost his ability to walk and was saved only by 14 hours of surgery on his back. But immediately after the four-second fall there was another, more incredible miracle. He told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation: 'I guess you would call it a mammal began swimming beneath me and I'm thinking, \"Oh man, a shark is about to devour me\". 'I was on a show for suicide prevention and I mentioned that I thought there was this shark on this show and a man wrote into the show and he said, \"Kevin, I'm so very glad you're alive, I was less than two feet away from you when you jumped\". 'He said: \"It haunted me until this day; it was no shark, it was a sea lion and the people above looking down believed it to be keeping you afloat until the coast guard brought a ride behind you.\"' Landmark: By a stroke of luck, a witness saw Mr Hines jump from the vast bridge and alerted the coastguard . Conference: Mr Hines spoke at the New South Wales Police Force Mental Health Intervention Team conference in Sydney, Australia. The force attended nearly 50,000 mental health incidents last year . With temperatures in the bay's waters as low as 12C, Mr Hines could have died of hypothermia had a witness not seen him jump and raised the alarm. Mr Hines said he never intended to tell his story because he was 'embarrassed', but changed his mind after a life-affirming talk to 120 students, many of whom had suicidal thoughts. Now he has written a book about his experience, Cracked, Not Broken, and appears at conferences all over the world. With medication and professional help he has managed to reduce his symptoms, including the voices in his head which told him to jump on that day 14 and a half years ago. 'The message is very very simple,' he told ABC. 'You don't have to die this way.' Mr Hines says he is one of just 34 survivors of falls from the Golden Gate Bridge, which rises high above the San Francisco Bay, and the only one to become a mental health campaigner. Population: Sea lions basking on piers in San Francisco. Mr Hines said the theory was perfectly plausible . He spoke yesterday as part of the NSW Police Force Mental Health Intervention Team conference in Sydney. The force attended almost 50,000 mental health incidents in 2014 alone, and set up to conference to discuss how the often-misunderstood issue should be tackled. Mr Hines had talked about being saved by a sea lion before, including in a 2013 blog post. 'There are a large number of reporters and speculators who have claimed it was really a seal, and even those who have claimed that there was nothing but me in that water,' he wrote. 'However, I know that it was a sea lion and it is not a statistic anomaly. Marine animals (dolphins, sea lions) and other creatures have helped save humans and other animals from dangerous situations all over the world. 'I say believe it or don\u2019t, that\u2019s completely up to you. I know the truth, and in this case and that is all that matters.'

The Turner Prize-winning artist teamed up with the organisation Living Architecture to design the unique holiday cottage in the sleepy village of Wrabness. But locals - who battled the original plans - claim art fans flocking to catch a glimpse of the artist's creation are clogging up the narrow streets. Scroll down for video . The finished work - which can be seen from miles around - includes ceramic tiles featuring safety pins, old-style tapes, hearts and the word 'Julie' The quirky cottage was supposed to 'explore the special character and unique qualities of Essex' and is expected to open for holiday bookings in the spring. But the local council has already been forced to redesign surrounding roads and car parks to accommodate the influx of art fans. One frustrated villager, who refused to be named, said: 'This is a tiny village known for its tranquillity. 'We're not a snotty London art gallery, yet our tiny roads are now besieged on a daily basis by day trippers asking for directions to the dreaded 'Gingerbread House'. 'I can only imagine how bad it will be in the summer. 'I still do not understand how this abomination got planning permission in the first place?' Wrabness Parish Council strongly objected to the proposal to knock down the existing farmhouse and replace it with the imposing structure that combines sculptures, tapestries and ceramics. Villagers in Wrabness have said that\u00a0Grayson Perry's 'Gingerbread house' has caused traffic chaos . The Turner Prize-winning artist is known primarily for his work with ceramics, and right, the house in honour to a mythical Essex woman called 'Julie' The original plans for the home were turned down by Tendring District Council but a re-submitted application for the wacky home was given the green-light by planners. The finished work - which can be seen from miles around - includes ceramic tiles featuring safety pins, old-style tapes, hearts and the word 'Julie'. Perry admitted he had originally designed the house whilst \u2018doodling wildly and quite drunkenly in front of the television\u2019. The house is located on the banks of the River Stour, in the rural village of Wrabness . He wanted it to resemble a \u2018jewel box\u2019 that told the story of a mythical Essex woman called Julie, who had a difficult childhood, love life, divorce and late career. Hence, there\u2019s an 8ft statue of her on the roof, naked and pregnant, and her name is emblazoned all over the walls. Essex County Council Highways Authority have now agreed to redesign tiny local roads to improve access to the site. Talks are also ongoing to use the nearby Wrabness Railway Station as a car park for art enthusiasts. The cottage - officially named 'A House for Essex' - is set to open to holidaymakers in the next few months . An Essex Highways spokesman said: 'Following a meeting, it was agreed to implement a number of requests for road improvements in Black Boy Lane, Wrabness. 'These include a variety of new and replacement road signs and renewed and repositioned road markings. 'Cllrs Bass and Johnson also agreed to write to NCP and National Rail to encourage them to discuss parking issues with the parish council.'

The documentary is presented by Ian Dunn, one of the founders of the Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE), which campaigned to legalise sex with children. It is one of 30 archive films on the BBC\u2019s website telling the history of the gay rights movement. The 30-minute documentary \u2013 Glad To Be Gay? \u2013 portrays Dunn as a legitimate gay rights activist and makes no reference to his role in setting up the reviled group. Victims of child abuse described as \u2018horrifying\u2019 the decision to upload the film. When The Mail on Sunday contacted the BBC to point out the documentary was causing offence, the broadcaster refused to take it down \u2013 on the grounds that it is a \u2018significant\u2019 work on the history of gay rights. The documentary, first shown on the BBC in 1976, shows the lives of gay people at a time when homosexuality was still illegal in Scotland, and featured interviews with future Foreign Secretaries Robin Cook and Malcolm Rifkind. It was an episode of a public access TV series called Open Door, and the BBC website states it was made by the Scottish Minorities Group and credits Ian Dunn as a presenter. Dunn, who died in 1998, is shown describing the work of the group in Edinburgh, while Mr Cook and Mr Rifkind were interviewed about their opinions on gay rights. The footage includes Dunn calling for the age of consent to be lowered, stating: \u2018We think a boy considered old enough to take responsibility of bringing up a family is surely old enough to make up his own mind.\u2019 But there is no mention in either the original documentary or on the BBC website of Dunn\u2019s role in campaigning for adults to be allowed to have sex with children. When MoS contacted the BBC (headquarters pictured) to point out the documentary was causing offence, the broadcaster refused to take it down \u2013 on the grounds that it is a \u2018significant\u2019 work on the history of gay rights . In October 1974, Dunn had co-founded PIE as an offshoot of SMG, and wrote that its goals were to campaign \u2018for the legal and social acceptance of paedophilic love\u2019. Last night representatives of victims of child abuse said the BBC\u2019s decision was at odds with refusing to show repeats of Top Of The Pops featuring disgraced DJs Jimmy Savile and Dave Lee Travis. Catherine Allen, of sexual abuse victims\u2019 charity One In Four, said: \u2018This is horrifying and shows complete contempt for those who suffered at the hands of Ian Dunn and other members of PIE. \u2018I believed the BBC had learned lessons from the Savile saga but they still aren\u2019t taking sexual abuse seriously.\u2019 Dr Jon Bird, of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood, called on the BBC to remove the film or amend it to make viewers aware of Dunn\u2019s warped views. The BBC said: \u2018This video \u2013 which doesn\u2019t involve or discuss any children \u2013 was considered a significant programme on gay rights and has been online for many years.\u2019",

        "document": "Of all the players Manchester City might have expected to drive the final nail into their Champions League coffin Ivan Rakitic was a long way down the list, but it was the former Sevilla midfielder who got the goal on Wednesday night. Here MailSport takes a closer look at the Croatian midfielder more than proving his worth in his first season at the Nou Camp. Ivan Rakitic superbly lifts the ball over the on-rushing Joe Hart to give Barcelona the lead against Man City . Rakitic loops the ball over Hart and past Vincent Kompany to earn Barcelona a 1-0 lead at the Nou Camp . When he signed in the summer what was the reaction? There was no hysteria but it was considered a welcome addition for two reasons \u2013 firstly they need midfielders after selling Cesc Fabregas to Chelsea and Thiago to Bayern Munich, and second Rakitic was, along with his fellow countryman Luka Modric, the best midfielder in La Liga last season. Is he an improvement on the aforementioned Fabregas and Thiago? Thiago has the potential to be the best of the three but appalling luck with injuries has stalled his career. Is Rakitic better than Cesc? Probably not but he has many of the same characteristics so that has made him a worthy replacement. The Croatia international challenges for the ball with Manchester City midfielder James Milner . Rakitic was brought to Barcelona from Sevilla for \u00a314million to replace Cesc Fabregas, who joined Chelsea . And those characteristics are? He is versatile in as much as he can play behind the striker and score goals as he did regularly for his former club Sevilla and he can play deep in front of the centre-back as he also did, although less so for his former team, and as he did for Bar\u00e7a last Saturday away at Eibar. Much like his compatriot at Real Madrid Modric, he can tackle, pass, and shoot. He\u2019s a very complete midfielder. Who brought him to Spain? Sevilla signed him from Schalke for \u20ac2.5m. It was another work of genius from the club\u2019s Sporting Director Monchi because within a very short space of time it was clear Rakitic was destined for bigger things and would make the club a tidy profit. Rakitic (laying down on left of trophy) captained Sevilla to Europa League glory in 2014 . Rakitic was born in Switzerland but plays international football for Croatia . Did he consider England? His wife, Raquel Mauri, is a hairdresser from Sevilla, and so he preferred to stay in Spain. When Barcelona came calling it was a no-brainer. He was close to going to Chelsea as a 16-year-old but his father advised him to move to Schalke instead. The language was not going to be a problem wherever he went because the Swiss born Croatian international speaks five languages. And his battle with Modric will be one to look out for on Sunday? It will. And even more so because Rakitic was denied the chance to face his international team-mate in the first Clasico of the season because he was left out of the starting eleven. Rakitic is mobbed by his Barcelona team-mates after opening the scoring against City on Wednesday . Midfielder Rakitic is joined in celebration by Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar Jnr . How did that work out for Luis Enrique? Badly. Many had tipped the coach to resist the temptation of giving Luis Suarez his debut after so long out, move Iniesta forward to the front three and bring in Xavi alongside Rakitic. Instead Luis Enrique dropped Rakitic despite the fact that he had been playing well and lined Xavi up alongside Andres Iniesta. \u2018They are great players but they are not getting any younger,\u2019 Paul Clement told me after the game. Barca started well but lost control of midfielder and ultimately the match. Without Rakitic they were completely out-run in the middle of the park. When he is at his best, he is their engine. Now he\u2019s back in the team for good? He didn\u2019t start against Malaga and Barca lost 1-0. He then played and scored against Granada. He is becoming a leader on the pitch and has bought into the ideas of sacrifice and generosity at Barcelona having been very much the talisman of the team at Sevilla. When he scored against Grandada he approached the bench to dedicate the goal to his best pal in the dressing room \u2013 the German keeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen and he even said of Luis Enrique: \u2018He knows what he is doing, we have to trust in him.\u2019 Former Sevilla and Schalke midfielder Rakitic attempts to escape the attention of Yaya Toure .",

        "document": "This is the moment a five foot long unexploded Second World War bomb discovered under a building site in south London was blown up. A controlled explosion was carried out in a quarry at Cliffe in Kent this morning after the German device was discovered under a former pensioners home in Bermondsey in the Southwark borough on Monday. Soldiers of 11 EOD (Explosive Ordnance Disposal Regiment) Royal Logistics Corps used two kilogrammes of high explosives  to blow up the Luftwaffe Sprengbombe-Cylindrisch bomb. Scroll down for video . Explosion: The unexploded German bomb found in Bermondsey, south London was blown up at a quarry in Kent at 9am this morning . Detonation: Staff Sergeant Ed Clinton (left) and Sergeant Rich McKinnon (right), of 11 Explosive Ordnance Disposal Regt Royal Army Corps placed the charges on the bomb and then walked back to a safe area 500 metres to fire the charge . The 1,000lb explosive was transported to the site in Kent, owned by Brett Aggregates, inside a skip packed with sand and loaded onto a lorry, which was flanked by police yesterday. The area in Bermondsey, Southwark, which was severely bombed during the Blitz in the Second World War, was put into lockdown from Monday night. It is believed the bomb was dropped over London by the Luftwaffe on 11 May 1941 but unusually did not detonate. More than 1,200 people were evacuated from their homes following the discovery by builders working on the construction site of the former Southwark Irish Pensioners centre. A police cordon sealed off 200 metres of land surrounding the bomb site for 32 hours as the Army built a bunker around the bomb to safely defuse it. The  teams, who had previously worked on Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) in Afghanistan and Northern Ireland, used Hesco blast walls, like those used to build Camp Bastion and other military bases in Afghanistan during the conflict there. A soldier in charge of removing it has revealed that if the bomb had exploded it could have led to 'major loss of life' and significant damage to buildings. Senior Ammunition Technician John Lester said it was a 'a live munition in a dangerous condition' which had to be taken far from the city before it could be safely destroyed. SAT Lester, of 11 EOD, Royal Logistic Corps, said: 'This bomb was a live munition in a dangerous condition. It had been disturbed by some pretty heavy building machinery, which is never a good thing. Bombs don't like being bashed around. 'But once we'd uncovered it, we knew what we were dealing with and it was just a question of solving the puzzle quickly so we could get it away and the good residents of Bermondsey back in their homes. 'We knew we had to get it away to dispose of it safely because trying to deal onsite with a bomb that size, even under a controlled explosion, would cause significant damage to buildings, (and) property, and the risk of major loss of life in such a highly populated part of the city was very high.' Proud: The soldiers from\u00a011 EOD (Explosive Ordnance Disposal) Regiment Royal Logistics Corps stand in the hole left behind after the explosive was blown up . The Ministry of Defence said it had had reports that this morning's explosion at Cliffe in Kent (the quarry before, left, and during, right) could be heard 10 miles away. These pictures show the devastating effects the bomb could have had if it was accidentally detonated in London . SSgt Clinton and Sgt McKinnon carry spades to the site of the quarry, where two kilogrammes of high explosives were used to blow it up . The authorities warned that 'remaining in your home is placing your life at significant risk' and residents were forced out of their homes on Monday night. Around 80 people were re-homed in hotels or empty council accommodation, while others had to sleep at houses of friends and family. Hot meals and tea and coffee were provided for nearly 70 people at the Seven Islands Leisure Centre and Canada Water Library during the day. Scotland Yard confirmed at around 6pm  that the area was deemed safe and residents could return to their homes. Residents were commended for their 'Blitz spirit' by local councillor Lucas Green, who referred to the residents as the 'evacuees of 2015', and said they had a mass phone charger swap', which was 'the modern day cup of sugar'. Cllr Peter John, Leader of Southwark Council has thanked the emergency services, St Johns Ambulance and the Red Cross for their support at the rest centres. He added: 'Thankfully we don't have to deal with unexploded bombs very often, but we do have plans in place to deal with such emergencies, and they work. Once again I want to thank residents for their patience and co-operation while the army and police carried out their work.' Transported: The fuse on the unexploded bomb was made safe by experts before it was loaded onto a lorry inside a skip filled with sand . Discovery: A Royal Logistic Core Bomb disposal expert checking the fuse on the Luftwaffe Sprengbombe-Cylindrisch bomb at the site in Bermondsey, south London . Destruction: A soldier in charge of removing it has revealed that if the bomb had exploded it could have led to 'major loss of life' and significant damage to buildings . Dartford Police warned residents in Kent that there would be a loud explosion this morning but they needn't panic. The Ministry of Defence said it had had reports that this morning's explosion could be heard 10 miles (16km) away. Writing on Twitter, they said: 'EXPLOSION: Plz don't panic if you hear a loud bang... Army due to safely detonate a WWII UXB discovered in London yesterday.' Residents reported hearing a loud bang after the explosion at around 9am claiming it 'rattled' houses. Andy B posted on social media: 'Massive bang heard in Meopham, house shaken!!'. On The Thames said: 'Judging by the massive bang and thud just then in Kent, I'd say the #Bermondseybomb is no more!'. Residents were evacuated on Monady night after the 1,000lb German ordnance was discovered by builders under the old site of the Southwark Irish Pensioners. Pictured: Bomb disposal experts excavate the device . A bunker was built around the bomb by Royal Engineers of 33EOD to protect the surrounding buildings in case of accidental detonation.

        "document": "Actor Joaquin Phoenix is fronting the latest animal rights campaign condemning the horrific conditions in China's dog leather trade. The Hollywood star  felt compelled to appear in a new video by People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) after being shown sickening undercover footage taken by the group. It showed terrified dogs being savagely beaten to death with a stick before having their skin ripped off their bodies and turned into leather. Introducing the clip, Phoenix said it was 'one of the worst things I've ever seen'\u00a0before detailing the barbaric treatment of the animals as the viewer is shown shocking scenes inside Chinese factories. Scroll down for videos . Undercover footage by an animals rights group shows factory workers beating dogs to death before ripping their skin off their bodies and turning it into leather to fuel a global trade in canine fashion accessories . The carcasses of dogs hang in the slaughteryard, the ground thick with their blood.\u00a0PETA Asia's investigator saw workers peel the skin off dogs who were still alive . Hollywood actor Joachin Phoenix felt compelled to appear in a new appeal by People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) after being shown sickening undercover footage taken by the group in December . A pair of gloves made using dog skin.\u00a0With dog meat restaurants popular in many parts of the country, several establishments later sell the animals' skin to leather producers, which likely sell to Western stores . He says: 'Dogs like these are taken from China's streets and beaten to death. 'Their skin is turned into leather gloves, belts and other accessories. 'Terrified dogs watch as those ahead of them are kicked and beaten over the head and then have their throats slit and the skin peeled right off their bodies. 'When their turn comes - it won't be quick.' The original footage, released by PETA in December, shows workers standing by a door at a slaughterhouse in the northern province of Hebei. As dogs are led through, the men kill them with a heavy stick. Sometimes it takes several blows to finish off the unwitting animals. Meathooks sway grimly in the foreground.\u00a0PETA Asia's investigator saw workers peel the skin off dogs who were still alive. Terrified dogs are snatched off the street and thrown into cages before being slaughtered and skinned . The skin is then turned into leather and sold to unsuspecting customers around the world, including, the group claims, in Britain. Phoenix said: 'If you buy leather gloves, belts or shoes, remember there no easy way to tell who's skin your really in. 'If you love dogs like I do, the please never buy or wear leather, whether it comes from a dog, a cow or any other animal.' In December, PETA founder Ingrid Newkirk said: 'PETA is sure that Britain, Australia and the U.S. are not exempt from the dog leather trade. 'Many British high-street retailers are importing cheap leather from China, so products made from dog skin are almost certainly on the shelves and in people's wardrobes. 'Skin looks the same, whoever it comes from, and Chinese dog killers are not likely to advertise their skins honestly, so it's impossible to tell if those leather gloves or wallets are made out of dog, cow, pig, or goat skin. 'PETA is calling on British shoppers to consider the terror that dogs and other animals endure when they're mercilessly slaughtered and make the safe, vegan choice in clothing and accessories for the holidays and every day.' Without conducting expensive DNA tests, it is virtually impossible to know exactly what kind of animal   leather is made from. The organisation said it visited three slaughterhouses and six processing plants in central China during a year-long investigation into the slaughter of dogs and the production of dog skin. Cruel hand: A pile of dog corpses on the back of a van. Their skin is being used to make gloves, shoes and other leather products at a factory in China, reports an animal rights charity . The skin is then turned into leather and sold to unsuspecting customers around the world, including, the group claims, in Britain . Dog hides drying in a room in the Hebei factory.\u00a0PETA and other rights groups say dogs are slaughtered throughout the country, with regulations on animal slaughter poorly enforced . A dog slaughterer told PETA Asia's investigator that the facility bludgeoned and skinned 100 to 200 dogs a day. About 300 dogs are kept in the compound, and some can be seen frantically climbing over one another in an attempt to escape the packed holding cell. Although the dog-meat industry in China is well known, this is the first time that the production of Chinese dog leather has been captured on camera. News agency Reuters confirmed the use of dog skin during a visit to an open-air leather processing workshop, where workers stretched washed hides to dry in the sun. With dog meat restaurants popular in many parts of the country, several establishments later sell the animals' skin to leather producers, workers at the Hebei workshop said. 'There are restaurants that sell dog meat and people that eat dog meat,' said one leather producer, who declined to be named because he was not authorised to speak to the media. 'These places have a person who specially comes and collects the skins; they'll go to each place and take a few,' he said, referring to the producers. 'It happens all over the country.' Officials of the quasi-governmental China Leather Industry Association declined to be interviewed, saying they had no knowledge of dogs being used in leather production. The Ministry of Agriculture did not respond to repeated requests for interview on conditions in the slaughtering industry, which it oversees.

PETA and other rights groups say dogs are slaughtered throughout the country, with regulations on animal slaughter poorly enforced. Dog skin yields a tough leather of generally poorer quality than that of sheep or cows, but which is also cheaper to make. The plants PETA visited were producing leather for export, said Haleigh Chang, one of the organisation's representatives. 'One owner of a processing plant told us they export dog skin as lamb skin,' she said, adding that lack of transparency on the part of producers made it hard to estimate the size of the dog skin sector within the overall leather industry. China has faced criticism for its treatment of animals, including bears, whose bile is used in traditional medicines. Tigers are also bred and killed, in some areas, for their pelts and bones.

        "document": "Jailed: Ali Adorus is currently in jail in Ethiopia after being convicted of terrorism offences . This is the Londoner who travelled on 'safari' with evil Islamic State killer Jihadi John. Ali Adorus, 33, travelled to Tanzania in 2009 with Mohammed Emwazi when the pair were held and questioned by security services before being deported. Adorus,\u00a0who was born in Ethiopia but grew up in London, is currently in an African prison after being convicted of terrorism offences. The married father-of-one was arrested in Ethiopia in January last year. Authorities say he entered the country in 2011 to try to establish Islamic rule through acts of 'terrorism'. Adorus grew up in a council house in north London and it remains unclear how he befriended Emwazi. He is believed to have worked as a security guard after studying at college in east London. Adorus was also known to the British intelligence services and received support from the controversial human rights group Cage, according to The Times. Along with German national Marcel Schrodl, the three were questioned by security services in Tanzania and later by British intelligence officers in Amsterdam and Dover. They complained about their treatment to Cage, who provoked outrage last week after describing Emwazi as\u00a0\u2018extremely kind\u2019 and \u2018beautiful young man\u2019. At his trial in Ethiopia, prosecutors said that Adorus was 'accused of trying to unconstitutionally change the government and introduce Islamic government in Ethiopia by terrorism'. But Cage said that he was simply visiting relatives and gave a false confession in Amharic - a language he does not speak - after being 'brutally tortured'. They said that the case 'confirms a worrying pattern of young Britons of East African descent being harassed by MI5 and later ending up tortured in a third country'. He initially faced the death penalty but was then jailed for four-and-a-half years, along with two other British nationals. An anonymous family friend said that Adorus's relatives would not discuss his case in Ethiopia. Friend: Adorus travelled to Tanzania with Mohammed Emwazi, revealed last week as the man behind the 'Jihadi John' mask . Neighbours on the estate where he grew up described him as a 'good lad' and said that they found it difficult to believe that he had been jailed. One of his neighbours in London described him as a 'kind, beautiful and innocent human being'. In August, his wife wrote on a support group: 'We will get him home soon, Inshallah!' Following his arrest and detention in Ethiopia,\u00a0Cage went on to petition the former foreign secretary William Hague and the Ethiopian ambassador over concerns that Adorus had not received a fair trial. In a letter on the Change petition site, they said: 'I have seen information according to which he was severely tortured in Maekelawi police station. 'According to an urgent appeal made to the United Nations, Ali Adorus was brutally beaten, handcuffed behind his back for an extended period of time, beaten on his hands with heavy wires, hooded, given electric shocks and denied access to a toilet.' Jihadi John: Mohammed Emwazi was expelled from Tanzania in 2009 for being drunk and disorderly on a flight from Amsterdam along with Adorus . In 2009, Adorus travelled to Tanzania with Emwazi and Schrodl, an Islamic convert who may have used the alias Umar and who described himself as a translator. The trio thought to have approached Cage about their 2009 treatment in Amsterdam, after their deportation from Tanzania. The group reported that they and Emwazi were 'repeatedly harassed' by the Dutch and British authorities. Cage compiled a report in which it accused their interrogators of comparing Muslims and Islam to dogs and terrorism. The group said that Adorus had been told by security service officers that 'our details will be passed to the secret services of the whole world'.",

        "document": "EU chief Jean-Claude Juncker has called for the creation of an EU army . Brussels chief Jean-Claude Juncker has called for the creation of an EU army in the wake of rising tensions with Russia. The European Commission President said an EU military force would help defend the continent from Vladimir Putin's aggression. He said: 'You would not create a European army to use it immediately. 'But a common army among the Europeans would convey to Russia that we are serious about defending the values of the European Union.' He said a joint EU force would be more economical than each country individually ordering their own military kit. It would also drive further integration of the bloc's 28 member states. 'Such an army would help us design a common foreign and security policy,' the former Luxembourg prime minister said. He insisted the army would not challenge NATO's role defending Europe from Russian aggression. Mr Juncker, speaking to the German newspaper Welt am Sonntag, said: 'Europe's image has suffered dramatically and also in terms of foreign policy, we don't seem to be taken entirely seriously.' The proposal is likely to infuriate Conservative backbenchers but has been welcomed in Germany. Germany's Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement that 'our future as Europeans will one day be a European army' although she added 'not in the short term'. She said such a move would 'strengthen Europe's security' and 'strengthen a European pillar in the transatlantic alliance'. But\u00a0Ukip's defence spokesman Mike Hookem said a European army would be 'a tragedy for the UK'. He said: 'We have all seen the utter mess the EU has made of the eurozone economy, so how can we even think of trusting them with this island's defence? 'This is simply a disaster in the making that would see Gibraltar returned to Spain and the Falkland Islands left open to an unopposed invasion by Argentina. 'Even more concerning would be the prospect of British troops under European command operating in the eastern Ukraine.' European Commission President said an EU military force would help defend continent from Vladimir Putin's aggression . Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said relations between Russia and the EU are likely to be 'prickly' for many years . It comes amid warnings that relations between Russia and the EU are likely to be 'prickly' for many years. The Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond warned that significant further sanctions could be imposed by the EU unless Moscow abided by the terms of the Ukraine ceasefire. He said under Mr Putin Russia had moved from being a partner of the West to seeing Europe as an 'adversary'. Mr Putin's view of Russia's influence over former Soviet states 'puts him at odds' with the West, Mr Hammond said. Newly mobilized Ukrainian paratroopers wait to board a helicopter as tensions rise with Russia . On BBC1's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Hammond warned that further aggression by Moscow-backed separatists in Ukraine would trigger an escalation in the sanctions regime. 'We have all made clear that if there is a big assault, for example on Mariupol, that will be responded to with a significant increase in the economic pressure on Russia from the EU,' he said. Asked if that could trigger a new Cold War he said: 'I don't want to talk about cold wars, but we are clear that Russia has decided, it has made the decision that it wants to be in a strategic competition with the West, with Europe. 'It doesn't any longer see us as partners, it sees us as competitors or even adversaries and that means that we are going to have a difficult, prickly relationship with Russia probably for some time to come.' 'We don't think there can be a military resolution to this crisis. The disparity between the size of the Ukrainian armed forces and the Russian armed forces doesn't make that a sensible way to go. 'We have to insist that the rules-based system which says very clearly that you can't change international boundaries by force, is protected.' Although Mr Hammond said it was clear that 'we are not going to fight the Russians in Ukraine', the UK was providing support to Kiev. 'We are providing training, we are providing technical support, we provide them with non-lethal equipment,' he said. 'We have said that we will keep this under review.' He said that under the peace plan agreed in Minsk, Moscow has committed to handing back control of all of Ukraine's territory, including the border with Russia, by the end of this year. 'We have to hold them to that. If that doesn't happen Russia can expect the temperature to be turned up significantly,' he said. A machine gun sits inside a pro-Russian rebel trench along the front lines two kilometers from Ukrainian troops . He stressed that there was a 'hard red line' protecting Nato's Baltic members from Russian incursions, with the option of invoking the alliance's measure allowing for collective defence: 'Mr Putin knows that very well and that is what protects the Baltic states.' Mr Hammond claimed the Russian president believed he had 'some kind of strategic veto' over the freedom of action of former Soviet states. 'That puts him, frankly, at odds with our view of the post-Soviet settlement in Europe,' the Foreign Secretary said. Pressed on the Nato 2% spending target, Mr Hammond said: 'I can't tell you what will be in the Conservative manifesto, but you will find out soon enough, and I can't prejudge the outcome of the security and defence review and the spending review that will take place after the next election. 'But David Cameron led the charge on the Nato 2% commitment at the summit in Wales last year.'",

David Cameron said his 11-year-old daughter was campaigning against the BBC\u2019s decision to suspend the presenter over a \u2018fracas\u2019 with a producer. Mr Clarkson is an Oxfordshire neighbour and family friend of the Camerons. Scroll down for video . David Cameron's daughter Nancy, 11, \u2018threatened to go on hunger strike\u2019 unless Jeremy Clarkson is restored as Top Gear host . Despite the 'threat', which her parents have joked about, Nancy appeared to be enjoying dinner with her family . The PM told the BBC: \u2018Nancy has threatened to go on hunger strike unless Jeremy Clarkson is restored. \u2018I\u2019ve told her this is not necessarily a useful intervention. It\u2019s not exactly Gandhi, we had a discussion about this this morning.\u2019 Samantha Cameron chipped in: \u2018Nancy\u2019s hunger strike this morning lasted approximately five minutes\u2019. The Prime Minister quipped: \u2018It\u2019s between lunch and tea is the way it works.\u2019 During the interview, Mr Cameron and BBC Political Editor James Landale went to a local butcher near his constituency home in Witney, Oxfordshire. They then went back to Mr Cameron\u2019s home where the PM was interviewed while preparing food in his kitchen. Clarkson was suspended two weeks ago following allegations of 'a fracas' with Top Gear producer Oisin Tymon (right), prompting the top-rating show to be pulled off air . Nancy's siblings Florence (left) and Elwen tuck into a dinner of cold meats and a healthy salad, prepared by Mr Cameron . Mr Cameron was seen visiting a butchers shop in his Witney constituency, and joking about 'juicy thighs' In the shop, Mr Cameron chose some chicken, saying: \u2018I like the thighs because they\u2019re very juicy.\u2019 He also denied being the shop\u2019s most famous customer, pointing out \u2018Mr Clarkson pops in from time to time doesn\u2019t he?\u2019. Mr Cameron said it was very important to him that his children \u2018feel very rooted and grounded\u2019 in Oxfordshire. One of his children, he said, calls 10 Downing Street \u2018the pretend home\u2019. The interview appeared to show Mr Cameron\u2019s kitchen contains a red chopping board emblazoned with \u2018Calm Down Dear\u2019 The PM was accused of sexism in 2011 after using that slogan, taken from a TV advert, against Labour front bencher Angela Eagle. Mr Cameron has previously said his children would be \u2018heartbroken\u2019 if Top Gear was taken off air. When details of the incident emerged, he backed calls for Mr Clarkson to be reinstated. \u2018Because he is such a huge talent and he amuses and entertains so many people, including my children, who\u2019d be heartbroken if Top Gear was taken off air, I hope this can be sorted out,\u2019 he said.",

Ms Patel, who represents Witham in Essex, has called for John Clarke to be de-selected  after he compared her to a 'village idiot' on Twitter. He has since apologised, but Ms Patel has urged Labour leader Ed Miliband to take action against Mr Clarke, who she labelled a 'nasty piece of work'. Conservative MP Priti Patel (left) has accused her Labour election rival John Clarke (right) of sending her misogynistic and racist tweets, one of which likened her to a 'sexy Bond villain' The mother-of-one told Mr Miliband that Mr Clarke had been making 'derogatory, sleazy and demeaning comments, which had misogynistic and racist undertones to them'. In December, Mr Clarke responded to a tweet featuring Ms Patel's comments on the Autumn statement, writing:\u00a0'Witham calling: the village is missing its idiot! Come home Priti Patel...' Later that month he added: '@pritipatelmp was elected to represent the constituents of Witham, NOT the Indian community (note I didn't say Asian...why?)' In February he sent Ms Patel a link to another tweet asking:\u00a0'There's a woman on the Conservative front bench who looks like she'd be the Sexy Bond Villain. Who is she!? #PMQs' He wrote: '@pritipatelmp If you're the \"sexy Bond villain\" does that make me Bond, James Bond? (Cue the music!)' In December, Mr Clarke responded to a tweet featuring Ms Patel's comments on the Autumn statement, writing: 'Witham calling: the village is missing its idiot! Come home Priti Patel...' In February Mr Clarke sent Ms Patel a tweet which likened her to a James Bond villain . Ms Patel told Labour leader Ed Miliband that Mr Clarke had been making 'derogatory, sleazy and demeaning comments, which had misogynistic and racist undertones to them' Last week the former teacher and university lecturer emailed Ms Patel to say: 'I would like to apologise to you for any offence caused and assure you that any inaccuracies will not be repeated' The next week he wrote: '@pritipatelmp Did the character Deepa on the Channel 4 programme UKIP first 100 days remind u of anyone? 'Like....Selling out principles, etc'. Ms Patel, who was elected in 2010 with a 15,000 majority, also accused Mr Clarke of 'lies' after he claimed in a leaflet that she employed her husband Alex Sawyer on more than \u00a350,000 a year. 'He has been trolling me for ages and ages,' she said. Priti Patel was elected to the seat of Witham in Essex in the 2010 election, having been placed on the Conservatives 'A-list' of prospective candidates following David Cameron's selection as party leader. She won the seat, created following a boundary review, with a 15,000 majority. Ms Patel was born and raised in London after her parents came to Britain from Uganda in the 1970s. She studied at Keele University and the University of Essex, and after graduating, was given a job at Conservative Central Office but then left to work in the press office of the Eurosceptic, single issue Referendum Party. She rejoined the Conservatives in 1997, working in William Hague's press office, but left to join Weber Shandwick. Ms Patel stood as a Conservative candidate in the 2005 general election but lost the Nottingham North poll in a landslide to long-standing Labour MP Graham Allen. Ms Patel is known for her strong stance on crime, but has been criticised for her support on tobacco industry positions and had voted for the smoking ban to be overturned in 2010. She is married to marketing director Alex Sawyer, and the couple have a son, Freddie, who was born in  2008. 'I wrote to Ed Miliband and asked him \"what are you going to do about this nasty piece of work? Is this party policy? Do you sanction this sort of behaviour?\" 'I have had no response so I wrote him another letter asking him \"what are you going to do?\" 'On Friday I got a one-line email from him saying \"Ms Patel I apologise\" and that was it,' said Ms Patel, whose parents were Ugandan immigrants of Indian heritage who moved to Britain in the early 1970s. Last week the former teacher and university lecturer emailed Ms Patel to say: 'I would like to apologise to you for any offence caused and assure you that any inaccuracies will not be repeated.' A Labour Party spokesman said: 'The candidate has apologised for any offence caused and we are satisfied that any inaccuracies will not be repeated.' But Ms Patel retorted last night: 'Until Ed Miliband turns around and says 'this is not acceptable, we are taking action against this individual', it is simply not enough.' She added: 'It is not just what he has put on Twitter, it has been his conduct for what has been a considerable period of time. 'I could take further action if I want to. 'I am going to get back in touch with Ed Miliband and say: \"Are you going to stand by this guy? Are you sanctioning this kind of behaviour basically?\" 'The apology does not go nearly far enough. 'As if he can brush that under the carpet after publishing a leaflet with loads of lies about me. 'In my opinion he is totally unsuitable for public office.' Conservative Party vice chairman Rebecca Harris has also demanded that Mr Clarke is sacked and replaced. 'This sort of behaviour does nothing to improve the image of politics in the eyes of the public, and I believe may be a deliberate attempt to appeal to the most unpleasant racial prejudice in our society,' she said. Mr Clarke is yet to comment on Ms Patel's call for him to be de-selected. Ms Patel has written to Ed Miliband to ask him to take action against Mr Clarke, calling her rival for the Witham seat a 'nasty piece of work'",

But now, Professors Stephen Hawking and Brian Cox also share the honour of becoming fully fledged brands by turning their names into trademarks. Hawking, 73, whose life was played out in the successful biopic The Theory of Everything released this year, has applied to the Intellectual Property Office to have his name formally registered. Cox, 47, the Human Universe presenter, has already made the move. Professor Hawking has turned his name into a brand to prevent inappropriate retailers exploiting it . Online retailers, such as the site Redbubble, sell T shirts featuring a zombie Stephen Hawking above the words 'Hawking Dead' There is a wide range of Stephen Hawking memorabilia online, many of which include corny catchphrases . This will enable the pair to sell their brands for anything from greetings cards to disability aids to set up an educational charity. The principle reason behind Professor Hawking's move to trademark his name is for charitable purposes. It will give him the option of setting up a foundation, such as one promoting physics or for research into motor neurone disease, which has left him paralysed since he was diagnosed aged 21, in 1963. The move will also prevent others from exploiting his name with inappropriate products and sees him join the ranks of celebrities who have turned their names into brands, such as JK Rowling and David Beckham. There is a wide range of Professor Hawking memorabilia available on the internet, including a thong with his quote 'while there may be primitive life in our region of the galaxy, there don't seem to be any advanced intelligent beings', inked on the front. There is also a pair of boxer shorts, available for \u00a38, with a cartoon sketch of the scientist on and T shirts\u00a0featuring a zombie Professor Hawking above the words 'Hawking Dead'. A spokesman for Cambridge University, where he is a director of research at the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, told the Sunday Times: 'It's a personal matter, it is not a university issue, but he has taken measures to protect his name and the success it has brought.' TV science presenter Brian Cox has also turned his name into a trademark to prevent retailers cashing in on it . This Brian Cox doll is selling for \u00a312.99 on Amazon (left), while the 'I love Brian Cox' badges are available for \u00a31 . Mr Cox, who was also a keyboard player in the band D:Ream that produced the hit record Things Can Only Get Better (later used as a New Labour election anthem), may have also branded his name to protect his reputation. Amazon is selling a Brian Cox doll, at \u00a312.99, which is described as being as 'cuddly as the brilliant Professor Brian Cox himself'. Retailers also offer coffee mugs bearing his face and T shirts with slogans such as 'I will do science to you', 'I am the master of the universe', and simply 'I love Cox'.",

        "document": "Daily paracetamol could raise the risk of heart attacks, stroke and early death, a major study has warned . Daily paracetamol could raise the risk of heart attacks, stroke and early death, a major study warns today. It found that patients prescribed high doses of the painkiller for long periods were up to 63 per cent more likely to die unexpectedly. The risk of having a heart attack or stroke was up to 68 per cent higher and there was an almost 50 per cent greater chance of having a stomach ulcer or bleed. Paracetamol is considered by doctors to be safer than aspirin, which can cause stomach bleeds, and ibuprofen, which has been linked to heart attacks and strokes. But British researchers who looked at studies involving 666,000 patients say the risks may have been underestimated and are calling for a major review to be conducted into the drug\u2019s safety. They think paracetamol may be causing illness by preventing the action of an enzyme in the body called COX-2. Scientists from the Leeds Institute of Rheumatic and Musculoskeletal Medicine looked at eight studies that contained information on patients taking paracetamol daily for up to 14 years, for conditions such as arthritis and severe back pain. They also covered patients who took the medicine less often or hardly at all. Philip Conaghan, who led the research, pointed out that for most patients the risks were very small and those given paracetamol over a long period would have illnesses likely to kill them early. For this reason it was difficult to be sure the drugs were causing problems. But the professor added: \u2018I am a bit worried that paracetamol at high dose for long periods could be associated with side effects that we hadn\u2019t previously associated.\u2019 He said patients being prescribed the drugs for long periods for arthritis or muscle and joint pain should talk to their doctor about alternative treatments, such as exercise. Published in the journal, Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases, the study concluded: \u2018Given its high usage and availability, a systematic review of paracetamol\u2019s efficacy and tolerability in individual conditions is warranted.\u2019 Professor Conaghan said it was not possible from the studies to work out how the average person\u2019s lifetime risk of a heart attack or stroke would increase if they took paracetamol for a long period. The risk of having a heart attack or stroke was up to 68 per cent higher and there was an almost 50 per cent greater chance of having a stomach ulcer or bleed, for those who took the drug for longer periods . Statistically, one in six men and one in ten women will die from heart attacks, strokes and other complications of heart disease. Other scientists played down the risks. Professor Nick Bateman, who specialises in clinical toxicology at the University of Edinburgh, said: \u2018Based on this study the risk is minimal. Paracetamol remains the safest analgesic available, and this study should not stop people taking it. \u2018Based on these results, the lowest effective dose for the shortest necessary period is advised, this is common sense for all medicines.\u2019 Paracetamol is the most commonly used painkiller in the UK and 22.5million prescriptions are handed out each year. A further 200million packs are sold over the counter. Although the NHS does not keep figures, evidence from Canada suggests that 5 per cent of the population are given at least one high dose prescription of paracetamol over the course of a year. A 2013 Oxford study warned that for every 1,000 patients on ibuprofen or a similar drug, three would suffer a heart attack within a year, of which one would be fatal.",

Manuel Pellegrini suggested after City's 1-0 defeat in the Nou Camp that the number of games English clubs played in December and January meant they struggled in the latter stages of the Champions League. City's 3-1 aggregate defeat followed Arsenal's exit at the hands of Monaco on Tuesday and Chelsea's defeat by Paris Saint-Germain last week \u2013 leaving no English clubs in the last eight of the Champions League for the second time in three seasons.

Jamie joined Only One Direction in 2012 after being contacted by an old friend who had signed on to play the part of Harry Styles. He said: 'I knew Henry Allan, who plays Harry Styles - we were in the West End Gospel Choir together. 'He called me and said, \"Hey, I\u2019ve got a really fun opportunity. It\u2019s for a 1D tribute,\" three years later, I\u2019m still here.' Since then the group have toured the UK, Ireland and the UAE. Jamie said: 'It\u2019s been a rollercoaster for us.  It\u2019s complete madness. 'I entered this group thinking that it would be a little pocket money but it quickly became a full time job. 'I was always sheepish about saying, I\u2019m in a 1D tribute but truthfully, I\u2019m very proud of the shows we put on.' Zayn with the rest of One Direction in 2012 .

For the meantime, Jamie is going to continue performing as Zayn, but even if all the members of the real One Direction decide to throw in the towel, he has his own music to fall back on.

        "document": "Lynne Hughes, 33, suffers the rare sleep disorders narcolepsy and cataplexy. She falls asleep suddenly up to six times a day often collapses in the street . Waking from her sleep-walking state, Lynne Hughes was horrified to discover she had punched her husband in the face, breaking his nose. But the mother-of-two's outburst was not intentional or malicious. The 33-year-old is a diagnosed narcoleptic, and falls asleep without warning up to six times a day. She has woken to find she has sprayed Mr Muscle cleaning products on vegetables while cooking dinner and has come round to find she's made herself a sandwich. But for Mrs Hughes, who also suffers the related sleep disorder cataplexy, her illness has a serious side. Cataplexy causes a sufferer's muscles to completely relax, rendering a person unable to move, while remaining fully conscious. And twice while lying paralysed and helpless in a cataleptic state the street, she has been targeted by heartless thieves. Although she couldn't move, the 33-year-old felt hands raiding her pockets, removing her bank cards and mobile phone, while they pretended to help her. The conditions leave her prone to acting out her dreams as she sleep walks around the family's home in Mold, Flintshire. The bath has been removed, to prevent Mrs Hughes falling asleep in it, and she has stopped using a kettle. She said her 'life-changing' sleep episodes are often triggered by laughing or crying. She no longer goes out alone and never carries more than a few pounds in cash in her bag. She said: 'It's changed my life completely. 'On a couple of occasions I've been robbed. Remember, I can't move but I am still aware so I can feel their hands going into my pockets. 'It happened in Chester in about 2008 and then in Connah's Quay three years ago. 'It was people pretending to help me but really they took my bank cards and phone out of my pockets. 'I knew what was happening but couldn't do anything as the more stressed I got the worse the cataplexy got. 'I do not go out alone now.' Narcolepsy, which affects about 30,000 people in the UK, can cause excessive sleepiness and affects the brain's ability to regulate the normal sleep-wake cycle. Cataplexy is a co-existing condition which brings on episodes of muscular weakness triggered by strong emotions such as laughter, anger and surprise. In Mrs Hughes' case it causes her to regularly collapse, often after she has been laughing or crying. 'I've had to have my bath taken out because I wasn't safe to use it. I can't use a kettle either,' she said. 'My husband makes me a drink and puts it in the thermos flask.' Mrs Hughes has had many bad experiences in public when she collapses in uncomfortable or unfortunate places. She said: 'People will step over me if I fall down in Tesco. The mother-of-two, has woken from an episode to find she has punched her husband Richard, pictured, in the face, breaking his nose. And the 33-year-old has also sprayed Mr Muscle cleaner on vegetables while cooking dinner for her family. She said: 'It can be quite dangerous' Narcolepsy is a condition that affects around 0.05 per cent of a population. In the UK that equates to around 31,000 sufferers. It is a rare sleep disorder, which affects the brain's ability to regulate the normal sleep-wake cycle. It can cause symptoms including a disturbed night's sleep as well as excessive tiredness during the day. Normal sleep falls into a regular pattern of REM (rapid eye movement) and non-REM stages. Every 90 minutes or so, a normal sleeper experiences several minutes of REM sleep, where dreaming occurs. They then switch back to non-REM sleep. But, for narcoleptics, their sleep pattern is much more fragmented. This causes them to wake up regularly. In addition, REM sleep can come on very quickly during the day and night, producing dream-like hallucinations. Cataplexy is an episode of muscular weakness triggered by strong emotions such as laughter, anger and surprise. The loss of muscle tone ranges from a just-perceptible weakening of the facial muscles through weakness at the knees, to total collapse on the floor. Speech is slurred, eyesight impaired (double vision, inability to focus) but hearing and awareness remain undisturbed. Attacks often last less than two minutes, and they may only last a few seconds. Some people have repeated attacks of cataplexy which persist for up to 30 minutes. During both mild and severe attacks, the person stays fully conscious. Cataplexy may be most severe when the subject is tired rather than fully alert and can lead to considerable anxiety although anxiety itself is not a trigger. It is thought that about 75 per cent of patients with narcolepsy have cataplexy. Source: Narcolepsy UK . 'The narcolepsy makes me do other strange things as well. I'll fall into automatic behaviour. 'My brain will cycle in and out of a sleep state and my body will carry on going, so I'll wake up to find I've made a sandwich. 'I have no fine motor skills though so I'll have put about a pound of butter and a whole chunk of cheese on a slice of bread. 'It can be quite dangerous too - I once sprayed our vegetables for dinner with Mr Muscle instead of Frylight oil, but my husband noticed in time.' The 33-year-old was formally diagnosed in 2009, but suspects her condition dates back longer than that. 'When I was a teenager I'd start sleeping between lessons and my friends would wake me up on a rota,' she said. 'I just thought I was tired but looking back I realise that was part of it. 'I'm basically the text-book worst-case scenario. I had to do away with the bath because I'd sink down and I could feel myself start to drown but I couldn't do anything about it. 'My husband used to have to be in the bathroom to keep an eye on me.' Mrs Hughes hopes her story will help raise awareness of the conditions she lives with. 'You either curl up and feel sorry for yourself or get on with it,' she added. 'My cataplexic episodes are triggered by strong emotion. 'I can have a fall if I start crying or fall if I laugh. There's no warning. My little boy calls it a 'splat'. 'During milder episodes my speech will slur. 'When I had my little boy in January 2007, during the pregnancy I fell down a lot. 'I lived in a maisonette with two sets of stairs and every check up I'd come in with a bruised hand, a bruised head or another bump.' After visiting a number of different specialists and doctors, some of whom mistook her condition for fatigue and depression, Mrs Hughes finally recognised her condition as being narcolepsy when she was watching a documentary. She said: 'I just thought, \"that's me.\" 'I went to my GP and was referred to a sleep centre in Aintree. I was diagnosed within a few months.'",

        "document": "A young woman was run over by two taxis and killed in front of her boyfriend as they walked home together following a drunken tiff. Megan Hoskins, 20, was heard to shout at soldier Mark Hughes: 'just watch... the next car that comes' before apparently laying down in the road. As Mr Hughes, also 20, tried to tend to her, a black Hackney cab ran over her, closely followed by a Skoda Octavia minicab which tried to brake but came to rest with the care assistant trapped underneath. Megan Hoskins, right, was out with boyfriend Mark Hughes, left, on the night she died on July 20, last . The inquest heard that Ms Hoskins had taken cocaine, alcohol and cannabis on the night she had died . She was rushed to hospital but died of multiple fatal injuries less than two hours later. The tragedy occurred on July 20 last year while Megan, from Wigan, Greater Manchester was spending the weekend with Mr Hughes, who was on home leave from duty in Afghanistan. An inquest heard the couple who were planning to move in together had watched a movie before going to a friend's house where they drank a bottle of ros\u00e9 wine each and three cans of Fosters lager. Ms Hoskins also took some cocaine with friends before their group travelled to the Newtown Working Men's Club in Wigan. Trouble began when Mr Hughes became angry over a man trying to dance with Ms Hoskins. They left at around midnight and continued the argument on the way home, where witnesses saw Ms Hoskins walking in front of and then behind her boyfriend. Mr Hughes told the Bolton hearing: 'A man had came over to dance with Megan and I said \"that's my girl, what are you doing?\" It did wind me up. I knew she wouldn't do anything but it did wind me up. We had a bit of an argument and decided to leave. Mr Hughes, right, got annoyed while out with Ms Hoskins, left, when a man approached her for a dance . A witness who overheard the row saw Ms Hughes lie down in the road, pictured, and shout 'watch now, the next car that comes' as a Fire Engine approached, which managed to avoid her but  was hit by a hackney taxi . 'We decided to walk home and were having a dispute, a stupid argument like couples do but nothing serious. I was jealous and it wound me up and we were having a go at each other. At some point walking home I made a comment and she laughed. 'We were crossing over the road and she was stood at the side of me to my right. I crossed over the road then turned to the left to grab her hand and turned round to see her and it took three or four seconds to figure where she was. I saw her lying in the road and that's when the cars have come.' Mr Hughes said he didn't hear Ms Hoskins fall or hear her shout for help and added: 'That's what I can't get out of my head. She would normally only fall over if she had heels on but she didn't have heels on. She didn't say anything. 'She would usually have a go at me if it was my fault. There was nothing.' Mr Hughes, pictured, said Ms Hoskins normally only ever fell over when out \u00a0if she was wearing high heels . Asked whether he thought she lay there intentionally,\u00a0Mr Hughes replied: 'I have thought that but she wouldn't have any reason to do that. Ours was a loving relationship and she was my best friend. She was always laughing and joking and she was a bubbly young lady. I had returned from work that weekend and planned to spend it with her.' Eyewitness Amy Howarth who was having a cigarette from her bedroom window said she heard raised voices and saw a young couple in the road below. She said: 'I could hear them shouting. 'When they reached my house the male crossed the road and at this point the female ran on to the road and passed him to get in front. She was in the road in the path of cars then shouted \"watch now, the next car that comes\". She carried on walking in the road. I could see a fire engine going to a call with its blue lights on. I thought it was going to hit her.' Ian Dunham, the driver of the fire engine said: 'I saw a person in the road. I turned the sirens off, I didn't swerve, and went on the wrong side of the road to give that person room. I knew they had had a drink so not to startle them I turned the siren off. 'I noticed it was a female and as we were travelling up I was watching where she was and she continued to walk not in the middle of the road but about a car's width from the pavement.' The inquest heard the driver black Hackney cab Brian Sharples could not have avoided a collision. Coroner Rachael Griffin returned an open conclusion after the inquest describing Ms Hoskins as 'caring' Joseph Parkinson the driver of the Skoda Octavia following behind him said: 'The taxi in front didn't so much swerve as rock. When the lights came on I took my foot off the accelerator and then without warning at all there was a figure in the road. I hit the brakes as hard as I could. I didn't have time to swerve. If I could have done, I would have done.' The hearing was told Ms Hoskins had studied health and social care after leaving school in order to help people. Tests showed she had traces of cocaine, cannabis and alcohol in her blood at the time of death which may have affected her judgement. Mr Hughes was initially arrested on suspicion of Ms Hoskins' manslaughter but no action was taken against him. Recording an open conclusion, coroner Rachael Griffin said: 'She was very clearly a bubbly young lady who was intelligent, bright and spent her life caring for others. In Miss Howarth's opinion, she believes Megan was deliberately standing in front of cars. We have heard from Mark that that didn't happen. 'I don't know how or why she was in the road. It could have been that she fell, although she would normally fall if wearing heels. It could have been that she collapsed. It could have been that she was purposefully lying in the road. 'Sadly for unknown reasons to me, through collapse or choice, Megan was lying in the road in the path of oncoming vehicles. The difficulty I have is I don't know why she was on the floor. The only person who can tell me why she was on the floor is Megan and sadly she is not here to tell me that.'",

Three days after slumping to its first defeat since last year's World Cup in a 3-1 loss to Brazil, the 2016 European Championship host recovered with a convincing display of attacking football.

DENMARK: Schmeichel, Wass, Kjaer, Sviatchenko (Hansen), Boilesen, Jacobsen, Kvist (Delaney), Krohn-Dehli, Eriksen (Schone), Bendtner, Vibe (Jorgensen) Lacazette scored from a rebound in the 14th minute with a powerful shot after Denmark goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel parried Antoine Griezmann's effort. Arsenal forward Olivier Giroud then doubled the hosts' lead with a shot under Schmeichel from Geoffrey Kondogbia's through ball. Denmark striker Nicklas Bendtner hit the post with a header just before the interval and the visitors had a couple of chances denied by France keeper Stephane Ruffier in the second half. 'We did better during the first half, but it's logical with all the changes we made,' said France coach Didier Deschamps.

France enjoyed most of the possession in a lively first half, with Dimitri Payet adding pace and creativity in midfield. After earning his sixth cap, Lacazette and his Lyon teammate Christophe Jallet were jeered by sections of Saint-Etienne fans, whose club is involved in a fierce local rivalry with Lyon. But Lacazette's goal silenced them and the whistles stopped. The bulky forward had another chance 10 minutes later but the French league's leading scorer saw his 20-meter shot pushed out for a corner by Schmeichel.

Giroud made it 2-0 in the 38th minute following a devastating run from Kondogbia, who beat the Danish defense before releasing the Arsenal striker. The Danes could not find the momentum that helped them to a 3-2 win over the United States midweek and their only chance of the half came when Michael Krohn-Dehli sent in a cross for Bendtner, whose header hit the base of post. The French were less dominant in the second half and their penalty claims were waived away after Lacazette took a tumble in the area between two Danish players. Saint-Etienne keeper Stephane Ruffier enjoyed a quiet evening but made two decisive saves after the hour-mark, denying Christian Eriksen's shot and another effort from Bendtner when the visitors enjoyed a spell of dominance.

'I f***** him up!' Cle 'Bone' Sloan, a former gang member, told the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, according to the documents. Sloan reportedly admitted to attacking Knight, the 49-year-old co-founder of Death Row records, as he lay in a hospital bed suffering from multiple head wounds. Terry Carter, a 55-year-old father, was the second man to be hit by Knight's truck. He died from the injuries he sustained. Scroll down for video . Marion 'Suge'\u00a0Knight has been charged with murder and attempted murder after a hit-and-run incident on January 29 in a Compton, California, parking lot. His lawyer Matthew Fletcher, pictured left on March 9, has said that 'There's no reason Mr Knight should be in jail' Cle 'Bone' Sloan (left) and Terry Carter (right) were the victims of the hit-and-run. Carter died of his injuries, while Sloan is recovering and allegedly told police that he 'f***** up' Knight before being run over . Sloan, 51, allegedly said that he had a verbal dispute on January 29 with Knight three miles away from the scene of the hit-and-run, according to the New York Daily News. It is believed to have been a result of an argument 30 minutes before between Knight and others on the set of the upcoming N.W.A. biopic 'Straight Outta Compton.' He then allegedly headed straight for Knight when he saw him at Tam's Burgers in Compton, California, - the location of the hit-and-run - about half an hour later. 'Sloan said he contacted Knight and began to punch him through the driver side window,' the report read. 'Sloan stated Knight tried to exit the red Ford but was stopped by his punches.' Sloan was walking away when he heard someone say, 'Look out', according to his account to the police. He said he was trying to turn around but was then struck by Knight's Ford F-150 Raptor. Knight's lawyer told the Daily News that Sloan had initiated both confrontations and that the former rapper never left his car. 'Sloan is trying to exculpate himself but all the while he's just killing himself. It's monumental,' lawyer Matthew Fletcher told Daily News. Knight (pictured on March 9, has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him and is in jail without bail. His lawyer Fletcher has said that Knight never exited the vehicle and was acting in self defense .

Suge never exited his vehicle. He was accosted by Sloan who challenged him to fight,' he added. Fletcher had previously said that Knight was acting in self defense to get away from what he thought was an armed assault. Carter made a one-minute call to Knight at 2.36pm the day of the incidents, phone records included in the police report said. Nineteen minutes later, police were called to Tam's about the alleged hit-and-run. Knight has been charged with murder and attempted murder, but he pleaded not guilty and is in jail without bail. Though prosecutors claim Knight intentionally hit Sloan and Carter with his truck, Fletcher believes 'There's no reason Mr Knight should be in jail'. 'Sloan's own words probe he drove across the entire city of Compton in order to have a confrontation with Mr Knight,' Fletcher told the Daily News. 'Mr Sloan proved by his own words what his intentions were and what he accomplished.'",

Villas-Boas's love of motors is no secret. He first told of his passion when in charge of Chelsea, revealing he owned five bikes and shares 12 vintage cars. Andre Villas-Boas pictured behind the wheel of a 1958 MG A roadster on Thursday morning . 'It feels fantastic,' Villas-Boas said. 'You feel the need for it. Driving is very adrenaline-fuelled and it makes me feel good. We all have our passions and respond in different ways. 'It has been a lifelong passion. My first bike was a 350cc heavy engine. I took my licence and drove it in a national competition in Portugal \u2013 then I broke my arm so I was out. 'I was coaching Porto youth at the time.

'One is for my collection, the other I ride it. I am a bit of a \"crazy head\" so I have enduro-bikes as well. I go into mountains with the big rocks and almost kill myself.

The traffic camera is on a notoriously busy stretch of the M4 (pictured) near Port Talbot, South Wales . But since November last year, it has been replaced with an 'average speed' check - meaning motorists have to drive more cautiously. Chris Hume, from GoSafe, the Wales Road Casualty Reduction Partnership, said he was 'disappointed' by drivers speeding between junctions 40 and 41 of the motorway. He said: 'Excessive and inappropriate speed remains a factor in collisions, associated fatalities, serious injuries and, in this case, also contributes to the traffic congestion. 'On average day there are still 80 motorists showing a complete disregard for the speed limit and putting lives at risk.' Drivers who are caught will either get three points on their licence with a \u00a3100 fine or the option of a speed awareness course for \u00a385.

Labour\u2019s Tristram Hunt allegedly made the remark during a Parliamentary debate last week. Mrs Morgan raised the comment when asked about sexism in Parliament in an interview to mark International Women\u2019s Day. Nicky Morgan today claimed she was condescendingly called 'love' in the House of Commons by her Labour opposite number Tristram Hunt . A Tory source said of shadow education secretary Mr Hunt last night: \u2018He ought to think what sort of message it sends to young girls in the classroom to see him use chauvinist put- downs to one of the most senior women in government.\u2019 In the interview with Sky News, Mrs Morgan also defended David Cameron against accusations of sexism, calling him a \u2018feminist\u2019. Mr Cameron came under fire in April 2011 after he responded to heckling from Labour frontbencher Angela Eagle by saying: \u2018Calm down, dear.\u2019 He later said he was \u2018hugely sorry\u2019 for the remark, which was taken from a TV advert. Mrs Morgan denied that the comment showed the PM was an \u2018innate sexist\u2019 and said he has a better record promoting women than the Lib Dems \u2013 pointing out there are no Lib Dem women in the Cabinet. Nicky Morgan said Tristram Hunt made the remark 'in the heat of the moment' during a fiery Commons debate on schools .

Higher education fees are strictly a matter for shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna, not Mr Hunt. Mrs Morgan also revealed she did not find the Commons chamber during Prime Minister\u2019s Questions intimidating. She added: \u2018Prime Minister\u2019s Questions is a tiny part of the week... The work we do in our constituencies, our surgeries, helping people, making the case for our areas to government, that is something women are absolutely brilliant at doing. \u2018The tone of the debate when you get women ... is very different.

        "document": "(CNN)Seeing a rainbow often fills people with a sense of joy, regardless of whether it is their first or 19th time witnessing the colorful creation. Rainbow Gatherings -- annual events that take place throughout the world -- encompass a vibrant mixture of the environment and people to produce a similar feeling of excitement. Photographer Matjaz Krivic's \"Somewhere Under the Rainbow\" series was shot over 19 years at Rainbow Gatherings in various countries. According to Krivic, the meaning behind the name of the events originates from an ancient Hopi Native American prophecy about \"Rainbow Warriors.\" Rainbow Gatherings involve a temporary community of people who meet to share their similar ideals -- peace, harmony, freedom and respect. Those participating in the gatherings collectively refer to themselves as a \"Rainbow Family.\" The community, which welcomes a wide spectrum of ages, comes together to embrace nature and establish an alternative space away from society's popular culture of consumerism, materialism and mass media. Those who attend are not required to pay any form of money, not even for food, and the gatherings do not have rigid structures of dominance nor one specific leader. Instead, Rainbow Gatherings are essentially idealistic movements driven by the convergence of its community's beliefs in a more equitable society and its people's love and tolerance for one another. \"The magic hat goes around and you put money if you have or if you want,\" Krivic said. \"(But) nobody needs to pay for the food. Everybody is welcome to go and eat there.\" Krivic says that Rainbow Gatherings also tend to take place in regions of the world that \"need to be healed\" after having experienced devastating conflicts. Past gatherings include those held in Serbia, Bosnia and Ukraine. \"I really don't like what's going on in this world. ... There's just so much stuff happening,\" Krivic said. \"You can always go to (Rainbow Gatherings) and stay there and have a nice time, and you don't even have to pay for it. It will be a nice time, nice energy, not aggressive.\" One of the most enjoyable aspects about Rainbow Gatherings is the many workshops and activities that are available, where people engage in and learn about everything from yoga and tai chi to meditation and healing techniques. Another significant part of Rainbow Gatherings is the all-encompassing sound. \"I like the music, I'm an audiophile. I like all sorts of music, but when I go there it's live, it's there,\" Krivic said. \"It's like two guys playing and eventually it's like 50 people playing and the music is just so beautiful.\" The first Rainbow Gathering took place in Colorado in 1972, and it is believed to have been organized by youth counterculture \"tribes\" from Northern California and the Pacific Northwest. Since then, the gatherings have extended to other areas in the United States as well as a number of different countries. The international gatherings generally take place during the summer, before August's full moon. According to Krivic, the exact locations of some of the Rainbow Gatherings are revealed through hand-drawn maps and presented to those who have attended a gathering in the past. Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. Krivic has had a diverse range of experiences at Rainbow Gatherings, and maintaining a consistent photographic process over the years has enabled him to witness firsthand the growth of his photography. Ever since his first Rainbow Gathering, Krivic has been using the same two film cameras and lenses. \"The gatherings didn't change,\" Krivic said, \"but my photography did change -- a lot. ... I consider photography differently now.\" Krivic says a key consideration when taking photos was the use of film cameras as opposed to digital, which he believes do not fit in with the atmosphere of the gatherings. He also had to carefully decide who to photograph. \"I had some friends and I could take photos of them, and then eventually when I was going on and on, it just became like a family,\" he said. \"It's like people that you know for 20 years and you see them every year.\" Just as every person sees a rainbow in their own unique way, \"Somewhere Under the Rainbow\" enables viewers to let their vision roam freely around every corner of the photos, leaving them to cultivate their own perspectives and ripen their imaginations. In one photo, Krivic takes viewers to Pakistan in 1998, where a man mesmerizes viewers as he stands in pristine blue water holding a mango in his hands. It's then 2003 in France. Light rays power through colossal trees, illuminating tents and tepees and dosing the atmosphere with warmth. Viewers later discover a delicate morning hug between a man and woman at last year's Rainbow Gathering in Hungary, with a sunflower softly blooming out of a ukulele. As for Krivic, he feels that \"Somewhere Under the Rainbow\" is not finished and will never be. \"I will never complete it. I will always go because I like it,\" he said. \"I will take photos again of friends, and just go on with it.\" Matjaz Krivic is a photographer based in Slovenia.

        "document": "His arms out-stretched in a hero pose, former international footballer Michael McIndoe milks the adulation as a spray of champagne washes over him. The 35-year-old wasn't celebrating a cup triumph but the millions flowing through his accounts from an alleged \u00a330million investment scheme that snared a string of top-flight players. Pictures have now emerged of McIndoe in 2011 - at the height of his scheme - surrounded by beautiful women and empty champagne bottles as he revelled in a millionaire playboy's lifestyle in Marbella with a limitless credit card and wads of cash. Former Wolves and \u00a0Coventry player Michael McIndoe celebrates in Marbella during the height of his scheme . A member of staff at the beach bar lifts a\u00a0Methuselah champagne bottle out of an ice bucket . Another former footballer revealed that McIndoe had spent \u00a340,000 on champagne in one day . McIndoe (second from the right) parties in Marbella using money earned from the elaborate scheme . McIndoe started out at Luton Town, making his debut in 1998 and playing for the Hatters 39 times before joining Hereford on a free in 2000. Yeovil then took advantage of the Bulls' financial plight and snapped him up for \u00a325,000 the following year. He scored 22 goals in 91 outings for the Glovers, winning promotion from the Conference in 2003 before joining Doncaster for \u00a350,000. McIndoe twice made the PFA Team of the Year with Rovers and was his side's joint-top scorer in 2004-05 with 12 goals. He twice represented the Scotland B side during his time at Rovers. After a loan spell at Derby he joined Barnsley then Wolves, on loan again, before the deal was made permanent for \u00a3250,000. He signed a three-year contract with Bristol City in 2007 and scored the winner against Crystal Palace in the second leg of the 2008 Championship play-off semi-final. They lost out to Hull at Wembley and McIndoe had one more season at Ashton Gate before joining Coventry. He also had a brief loan stint at MK Dons. But the former Wolves and Coventry midfielder, who is accused of persuading 300 stars including Jimmy Bullard as well as a string of lower league players to invest with him, is now being investigated by police. He was forced into a bankruptcy court with debts approaching \u00a33m earlier this month where he claimed to be penniless and living on the charity of friends and family. The Metropolitan Police are investigating and have started quizzing victims and associates. 'He was the Mr Big in Marbella, buying loads of champagne and girls all over the place. He even had a bodyguard,' said one footballer, who lost around \u00a375,000 in the scheme, which promised a 20 per cent return on investments. McIndoe, from Edinburgh, hired pop star Alexandra Burke to perform at a party and invested in a private members club, in London. But it was in Marbella that McIndoe indulged the lavish lifestyle - shown in these exclusive photos - he could not afford as his playing career ended in non-league football. He hired a modernist \u00a32m mansion for \u00a327,000-a-week for a three-week holiday spree and spent \u00a340,000 on champagne in one day at a beach club party. Friends had bottles of champagne and vodka at their tables whenever they went to nightclubs. McIndoe celebrates scoring for Doncaster against Arsenal in the League Cup in 2005 . McIndoe with the girlfriend\u00a0Emma Frain during one of his holidays in Spain . McIndoe used the promise of 20 per cent returns on people's money to fund his champagne lifestyle . The former Scotland B player rented a \u00a327,000-a-week mansion for a three-week holiday in Spain . 'There were lots of girls and lots of drink,' said the player, who had been befriended by McIndoe when he was a young apprentice at the same club. 'He was spending money like you've never seen before.' McIndoe was photographed lounging on a white sofa with his then girlfriend, model Emma Frain, and smoking a huge cigar while surrounded by friends as he bankrolled their luxury holidays. The player added that McIndoe targeted fellow professionals and businessmen football supporters and initially gave them the 20 per cent return paid monthly in cash. The scheme sucked in around 300 players and the former QPR and Hull star Bullard is thought to have lost around \u00a3600,000 which prompted him to go on the ITV reality show, I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here. He told original investors to get other 'clients' involved and they would be rewarded.

Large bottles of the expensive Dom Perignon champagne are buried into an ice bucket . Jimmy Bullard (pictured here in 2011) was one of the investors, and is thought to have lost around \u00a3600,000 . McIndoe lived at the five-star Mayfair Hotel, paying \u00a34,000 a week for a suite, and also rented a Belgravia apartment for an upfront \u00a3150,000 annual fee, it is alleged. He ran glitzy parties at celebrity nightclubs including Funky Buddha, in London, and drove around in a Bentley and a Maybach. He was reportedly gambling heavily before the scheme crashed and is said to have run through \u00a31m on bets with one bookmaker in a year. 'He had the gift of the gab but was very cagey about the scheme, saying the money was in property, gold or City investments,' added the player, who declined to be named. 'People were convinced when they saw him paying out but then he suddenly closed the scheme down. He kept telling me to wait and that I would be a wealthy man.' McIndoe celebrates sinking Crystal Palace to reach Wembley in 2008 . But he was consoled by Wayne Brown after Bristol City lost the 2008 Championship Play-off final to Hull . Another person to have been caught out by the former Scotland B international was glamour model Georgia Eden, who was one of 30 women hired to attend club nights organised by McIndoe. In total, McIndoe was due to pay the model agency who organised the women \u00a312,000, but the money never materialised. Speaking to the Daily Record, Eden said:\u00a0'We were asked to mingle around and talk to guests in the club. The organisers said they were really pleased with what we had done and we were told we would be paid within 30 days. Georgia Eden was one of 30 models hired to attend a event put on at a club by McIndoe . But Eden, along with her colleagues, was never paid for her work with the agency said to be owed \u00a312,000 . McIndoe (right) in action playing for his former club Wolves against West Bromwich Albion in 2007 . 'That date came and went and a lot of excuses were made to the agency. 'To have that amount of girls booked for one job was a really big deal so it was a big let down to not be paid for the work we had done.' McIndoe was made bankrupt in October last year with disclosed debts of \u00a32.4m. He told the London bankruptcy court this month that he had no income and was living off \u00a313,900 surplus from the sale of his mother's house but \u00a36,000 of that had been given to his girlfriend, who lives in Epping, Essex. 'That money has been running thin of late so I have been getting help from friends and family,' he told the hearing. He added that he was not working and was living with his mother in Edinburgh or staying with a friend in London. After the hearing, he faced accusations from creditors that he had not responded to their questions about repayment. 'I have nothing to say, I cannot comment about this,' he said. The hearing was adjourned until March 25 and he must attend a meeting with the bankruptcy trustee later this month. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.",

Police say they tried to stave off the mob with tear gas and opened fire, killing one person. The crowd targeted a 35-year-old suspect, identified as an undocumented Bangladeshi settler, who died of his injuries before officers could rescue him, said L.L. Doungal, the director-general of police in the remote Nagaland state, where the attack took place. The mob that broke into the main jail in the state's Dimapur district was comprised of \"thousands\" of people, Doungal told CNN. \"Many of them were students in uniform,\" he said. The suspect was accused of raping a local woman on February 23. Tensions between the native Naga and undocumented Bangladeshi migrants in the district have been simmering for some time, police said. On Thursday evening, thousands of people who were demanding the cancellation of trade permits for Bengali-speaking settlers, tore into the prison complex and pulled the suspect out. Police initially used tear gas and bamboo canes to rescue the inmate, but were not successful, Doungal said. \"There were students in uniform. So, we had to use minimum force,\" he said. The crowd planned to lynch the suspect, but he died from critical injuries suffered in the attack. \"We retrieved his body before it could be (hanged),\" Doungal said.

Charlie Willcocks, 24, acted quickly when Kirsty Reynolds went into shock following the birth of son Teighlun, who wasn't breathing and had started to turn blue. The father said he recalled a recent episode of the Channel 4 series, as he watches every week as it's Kirsty's favourite programme. Charlie Willcocks delivered his partner's son when she went into labour on their living room floor . Charlie says that it was watching his partner Kirsty Reynold's (left) favourite programme One Born Every Minute that had helped coach him through the delivery of their son\u00a0Teighlun (pictured) When Kirsty, a mother of six, began having contractions, she simply thought it was Braxton hicks, or a false labour, and decided to wait it out until she was sure it was the real thing. But as the contractions began to get more intense a couple of hours later, her niece phoned for an ambulance - which only came 15 minutes after Kirsty and Charlie's son had arrived. As Kirsty began to feel the baby's head starting to emerge, she moved to the couple's sitting room floor and told Charlie to fetch clean towels. The delivery wasn't a smooth ride and required Charlie to act quickly when the birth took a dangerous turn. Moments after he delivered his own son, Charlie realised the tiny baby wasn't breathing and was starting to turn blue. Teighlun joins Kirsty's other five children. Pictured clockwise from left: Kirsty with \u00a0Larrae-Esmee, Charlie with\u00a0Teighlun, Shannae, Charlie, Irelyn and Skye . Panic-stricken Kirsty went into shock but Charlie began to recall scenes from a recent episode of One Born Every Minute. He started to firmly rub the newborn's entire body until he choked up mucus and finally began to breathe and change to a healthy colour. Charlie, who works full-time at Fishers Services, recalls being shocked by his own actions and says the documentary saved their son's life. 'I think adrenaline just kicked in after initially being terrified. I just went into speed mode. If I hadn't seen that programme I wouldn't have known what to do,' he said. 'I would have just been doing what Kirsty was telling me to do. We watch it every time it's on as it's one of Kirty's favourite programmes. I'm still quite traumatised by it all.' After delivering his own son Charlie ran into complications when his baby began to turn blue from not breathing but the new father recalled a recent episode of the Channel 4 documentary and his actions saved their son . Kirsty, who has six children, Skye, nine, Shanae, eight, Charlie, six, Irelyn, five and Larae-Esmae, 16 months and now baby Teighlun, said she was in shock when she realised that she was in labour and the pair had to act quickly. 'I sat on the toilet and tried to feel for the baby's head and it was right there! 'I shouted at Charlie to get towels,' she said. 'Once my waters break, the babies don't take long to follow. I started to feel scared because I knew it wouldn't be much longer. 'When the baby came out he wasn't breathing and I just went into shock. I think Charlie is still traumatised from the whole experience!' Kirsty said despite her partner's shock, his quick reactions made the difference between life and death. 'The only thing he knew was from me watching One Born Every Minute. He just did the right things because he'd heard it on TV and knew what to do when the baby wasn't breathing.' Despite the difficult birth, the couple say they were extremely lucky that there were no more serious complications. Kirsty said: 'There is just so much that could have gone wrong. 'We feel incredibly lucky that everything worked so well. We'll be watching One Born Every Minute next Tuesday, that's for sure.'",

His 2012 firing was reported on the same day as the counter-protest against Chick-fil-A's Appreciation Day as thousands of gay couples flocked to restaurants to kiss during the summer of 2012. Things were looking rough for Smith and his wife, Amy, along with their four sons after they lost their home and moved into an RV. But there was silver lining for him and the chance for a new start when he was offered a new job as a CFO in Portland a few months later. 'I felt like, \"yeah, I got it. I am back'',' he said. However, nearly two weeks later, he was fired once again after his boss realized he was the man from the video. In the 2012 video that went viral, he told Chick-fil-A employee Rachel Elizabeth while at the drive-thru window that he did not know how she lived with herself and worked there . Smith posted a follow-up video apologizing to Elizabeth (above) which she accepted . As the incident continues to haunt him, he said he does not regret the stand he took but he regrets the way he spoke to Elizabeth. While Smith is unsure if the incident will ever go away, he has turned to meditation, and has written a memoir, A Million Dollar Cup of Water:\u00a0Discovering the Wealth in Authenticity. The controversy surrounding one of America's biggest fast-food chains began in 2012 after a series of anti-same sex marriage statements from Chick-fil-A's COO Dan T. Cathy. Local media had previously reported that the company, founded in 1946 by Cathy\u2019s father, S. Truett Cathy, sponsored several organisations and group which actively oppose LGBT rights and same-sex marriage. Chick-fil-A donated more than $3million between 2003 and 2009 to Christian organizations with a well-known anti-gay agenda, and in 2010 alone Chick-fil-A gave nearly $2million to such causes, according to reports. In June and July 2012, Dan Cathy made several statements against gay marriage. When asked about Chick-fil-A\u2019s backing of \u2018traditional\u2019 families with a husband and wife, Cathy responded 'Well, guilty as charged\u2019. He also stated that\u00a0Chick-fil-A is runs on 'traditional Christian values' and is 'very much supportive of the family \u2014 the biblical definition of the family unit'. In response, gay rights protesters launched nationwide boycotts and staged same-sex 'kiss-ins' at Chick-fil-A stores across the country. The book tells of how his backlash from the public took him from riches to rags, to 'true wealth'. In job interviews Smith is honest about the video, he said, but he thinks employers are scared to hire him because they think it could possibly reoccur again. In the original video posted three years ago, Smith waits in line for a free promotional water at a Chick-fil-A before expressing his disdain for the firm's support for traditional Christian marriage. Filmed by Smith on his own phone, the former CFO gets to the window of the drive-thru and starts to all-out bully the young female employee behind the counter, who remains calm and polite throughout the whole exchange. He said: 'I don't know how you live with yourself and work here. I don't understand it. This is a horrible corporation with horrible values.' Elizabeth tells him repeatedly to have a nice day and that it is a pleasure to serve him as well as saying: 'I'm staying neutral on this subject. My personal beliefs don't belong in the workplace.' As he drives off he tells the worker: 'I'm a nice guy by the way, and I'm totally heterosexual. Just can't stand the hate. It's gotta stop guys, stand up.' Once he posted the video and went back to work, he said his employees were shocked. Smith told 20/20: 'I got into work and the receptionist, the first thing, big eyes, 'Adam, what did you do?', she said. 'The voicemail is completely full, and it's full of bomb threats.'' After the video went viral, according to a MarketWire statement, Smith was fired from his job at Vante, Inc. They released a statement saying: 'The actions of Mr Smith do not reflect our corporate values in any manner. Vante is an equal opportunity company with a diverse workforce, which holds diverse opinions. In his apology video, Smith told Elizabeth he was sorry for the way he spoke to her and that she handled the situation with dignity and grace . Wanda Flory, of Swanton, Ohio, center, watches with Terry, (left), and her husband Richard, (center right), as Thea Grabiec, (right), kisses Sarah Shovan during the counter-protest against Chick-fil-A's Appreciation Day . Smith also told Elizabeth in his apology video that he was angry by the number of people who were supporting Chick-fil-A during the Appreciation Day and became unraveled . 'We respect the right of our employees and all Americans to hold and express their personal opinions, however, we also expect our company officers to behave in a manner commensurate with their position and in a respectful fashion that conveys these values of civility with others.' After losing his job at Vante, Smith removed his original video from YouTube and posted an eight-minute video apology to Elizabeth. 'I am so very sorry for the way I spoke to you,' said Smith in the video. 'You handled my frustrating rant with such dignity and composure. 'Every time I watch the video I am blown away by really the beauty in what you did, and your kindness, and your patience with me.' Smith explained that he was enraged by the number of people that had come out to support the chicken fast-food firm during last weeks 'Chick-fil-A's Appreciation Day' and lost his cool. Shown Smith's apology by an anchor on Fox News at the time, Elizabeth accepted it. She said: 'I do forgive him. I think he realizes how bad it was to make that tape. 'I feel sorry for him and his family, and for everything that has happened to him since.'",

        "document": "Eminent\u00a0psychologist Dr. Phil McGraw, known to TV audiences as Dr. Phil, is on his way to Atlanta, Georgia to help\u00a0the\u00a0beleaguered\u00a0boyfriend of Bobbi Kristina, Daily Mail Online has learned\u00a0exclusively. On the eve of Bobbi Kristina\u2019s 22nd birthday yesterday Gordon, whose social media presence had become increasingly desperate and erratic tweeted, \u201cI\u2019m so hurt I wanna do myself in, I know I have to strong [sic].\u2019 In an insight into his spiraling mental state, on Tuesday he tweeted \u2018You all blame me but I tried my best and it wasn\u2019t good enough sorry. \u2018 Earlier he tweeted the simple plea to Bobbi Kristina, \u2018I love you soooooooo much plz wake up.\u2019 Through it all, he has not been allowed to visit with her, as tensions between Gordon and the Brown family have escalated . On the edge: Nick Gordon was seen on outside North Fulton Hospital near Atlanta, where Bobbi Kristina was first taken after she was found unconscious face down in her bathtub . A helping hand: Dr. Phil is concerned about Nick Gordon and his on his way to offer assistance . It is five weeks since Bobbi Kristina was found facedown and unresponsive in a bathtub at the Roswell, Georgia, home she and Gordon, 25, shared. The only daughter of Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown has been in a medically induced coma ever since the horrific discovery just weeks from the third anniversary of her mother\u2019s death in eerily similar circumstances. The singer was found dead in a bathtub in her hotel near Los Angeles on 11 February 2012 just hours before she was due to attend a pre Grammy awards party. But unlike Houston\u2019s death that was ruled accidental, police are treating Bobbi Kristina\u2019s near drowning and injuries allegedly sustained by the 21-year-old as a criminal investigation. Two weeks after being admitted to Atlanta\u2019s Emory Hospital Bobbi Kristina was taken off her ventilator and had her breathing tube removed for fear of infection. Instead she was given a tracheotomy. But any hopes that this was a sign of her condition improving were dealt a devastating blow the following week when medics attempted to bring her out of her coma only for her to suffer a series of dangerous seizures. While Bobbi Kristina fights for her life a troubling picture of her relationship with Gordon, of drug use and domestic turbulence in the weeks leading up to the incident, has emerged. It was Gordon who found Bobbi Kristina and who was administering CPR when first responders arrived on the scene. But other than this, few details have emerged. There have been reports that Bobbi Kristina was under the influence of drugs and drinking heavily on the morning that she was found face down and unresponsive in the tub. Nick and Bobbi Kristina in happier times. Gordon has been banned from seeing her by the Brown family . In addition to this she had been using cocaine, heroin and Xanax in the months before the January 31 incident according to multiple sources who spoke to People. Just two weeks ago Gordon was forced to admit that police suspected drugs at the Bobbi Kristina and his Georgia home \u2013 a home owned by Houston until her death \u2013 as he gave up a legal battle to block law enforcement from obtaining CCTV footage from security cameras located at the Roswell residence. Lawyers for Gordon had tried to argue that the warrant issued on February 12 was an infringement of their client\u2019s privacy but they subsequently dropped the case. Meanwhile the nature of Gordon and Bobbi Kristina\u2019s union has come under intense scrutiny. Both have referred to each other as \u2018husband\u2019 and \u2018wife\u2019 in recent months but there is no evidence to support the assertion that Gordon \u2013 who was unofficially adopted into the family by Houston when he was 14 \u2013 has married the girl who he once knew as a \u2018sister.\u2019 In his most recent tweets Gordon who had previously called Bobbi Kristina his \u2018wife\u2019 refers to her as his \u2018fianc\u00e9e.\u2019 What is clear is that, in the weeks leading up to the incident that has left Bobbi Kristina fighting for her life, her life had become increasingly chaotic. Just four days before she was found in the bathtub she was involved in a car wreck when she lost control of her silver Jeep Liberty and drove headlong into a gray Ford Taurus. The driver of the Ford and a passenger in her Jeep were injured and taken to hospital according to a report from police at Roswell, Georgia. Gordon too had been involved in crashes and speeding offenses in the past months. Police were also called to her home on January 23 after reports of a fight there. A security guard at the gated community where Bobbi Kristina lives told a dispatcher that one of her neighbors reported people \u2018hitting each other and swinging\u2019 outside the three-bedroom townhouse. Officers attended the scene but found no signs of an altercation. Speaking to Daily Mail Online a former boyfriend of Bobbi Kristina who remains a close friend, Zach Jafarzedeh gave an insight into the torrid pair. He said: \u2018Nick has a short temper and Bobbi can be difficult. \u2018It was a tug of war, because they are both very stubborn people. Bobbie is very sweet, giving and caring, but she wants all of you, everything. \u2018And Nick like space, that\u2019s where a lot of the tension between them came from.\u2019 He revealed that Gordon was \u2018getting a little wild.\u2019 He said: \u2018He was getting into car accidents. He\u2019s been in about three or four accidents over the last couple of years. He\u2019s got a need for speed. He\u2019s getting these nice cars now the trust fund money is coming in [from Bobbi, sole inheritor of Whitney\u2019s estate] and crashing them life and right. \u2018He had a couple of Chevrolet Camaros. He liked fast cars, BMWs, that kind of thing. He cares, but he wasn\u2019t slowing down.\u2019 Against this backdrop, hostilities between Gordon and Bobbi Kristina\u2019s father, Bobby Brown, and other family members have publicly exploded with Gordon an increasingly isolated and ostracized figure. Gordon has accused Brown of only being after his daughter\u2019s money and he himself has been accused of that very same thing in return. Bobby Kristina\u2019s aunt Marion \u2018Pat\u2019 Houston is the executor Whitney\u2019s estate estimated at between $12 and $20million trust She took out a restraining order against Gordon in March citing aggressive remarks and tweets he had made and claiming that he was only interested in Bobbi Kristina because of her money. According to Pat the tweets, including one that read \u2018Loam I got bigger guns than you. Watch them react to this,\u2019 were specifically aimed at threatening her. Pat, who was one of Whitney\u2019s managers, has made no secret of her disapproval of Bobbi Kristina and Gordon\u2019s \u2018sibling\u2019 relationship having turned into something romantic. In increasingly erratic tweets Gordon has raged against singer Bobby Brown accusing him of being an absent father who has barely seen his daughter in the past four or five years. He has claimed that the responsibility for looking after both Whitney, who struggled with drug abuse, and Bobbi Kristina fell on his shoulders and that, now just 25, it was too great a duty to bear.",

        "document": "(CNN)Newly released al Qaeda documents, including letters to and from Osama bin Laden in the year or so before his May 2011 death, show an organization that understood it had severe problems resulting from the CIA drone program that was killing many of the group's leaders in Pakistan's tribal regions bordering Afghanistan. As a result of this pressure, al Qaeda officials were seriously considering relocating elements of the organization to other countries such as Afghanistan or Iran. They also entered into ceasefire discussions through intermediaries with elements of Pakistan's intelligence service, ISI, although the documents suggest that nothing came of these discussions and there is no evidence in the documents indicating that the Pakistani government had any clue about bin Laden's location or presence in Pakistan. CIA efforts to spy on the group and kill its leaders were so effective that in June 2010 an al Qaeda official urged bin Laden, \"You should have fewer exchanges of correspondence with us during this period. Make the period between contacts longer and further apart. Take excessive caution and care, especially this year.\" This was wise counsel. Within a few weeks of this letter being written, the CIA would track bin Laden's trusted courier to his longtime hideout in Abbottabad, Pakistan, and on May 1, 2011, a U.S. Navy SEAL operation ordered by President Barack Obama killed al Qaeda's leader. The new al Qaeda documents are part of a trove of many thousands that the SEALs recovered at bin Laden's compound. Several were released during the Brooklyn trial last month of al Qaeda operative Abid Naseer. Seventeen of these documents had also been released around the first anniversary of bin Laden's death. It's long past time for the government to release more of these thousands of captured documents -- with any necessary redactions for national security purposes -- as they help us to understand better what precipitated the decline and fall of the terrorist group that once dominated the attention of the world, just as ISIS does today. The documents show how al Qaeda's 9/11 operation unleashed so much force against it, including the CIA drone program, that it had to hide in the shadows and couldn't pull off any successful operation in the West for many years before the death of bin Laden. The documents demonstrate that almost a decade after 9/11 al Qaeda was struggling to get any kind of operation going against Western targets. In a report on \"external operations,\" an al Qaeda official explained that a plot to attack the U.S. Embassy in Russia had fizzled and that despite sending al Qaeda members to the UK to hit \"several targets\" these operations had also come to nothing. Al Qaeda had also sent \"three brothers\" on a terrorist mission to Denmark, a country that bin Laden loathed because of the publication by a Danish newspaper of cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed, but had \"lost contact with them.\" Given all the problems the group was having, an al Qaeda strategist suggested refocusing efforts on carrying out terrorist attacks using the \"simplest things such as \u2028household knives, gas tanks, fuel, diesel and others like airplanes, trains and cars as \u2028killing tools.\" 2011: U.S. offers details about bin Laden raid . A major theme of the documents is how much punishment the CIA drone program was inflicting on al Qaeda. Al Qaeda officials considered moving to Nuristan, a remote mountainous region of eastern Afghanistan, or to other parts of Pakistan such as Sindh or Balochistan and even to Iran, which had been a key sanctuary for a number of al Qaeda's leaders after the fall of the Taliban in late 2001. Al Qaeda mulled opening an office in Iran, but \"we backed off this idea due to financial costs and other considerations.\" In a letter to bin Laden, an al Qaeda official provided a vivid description of the death by drone of Mustafa Yazid, then the No. 3 leader of the group, on the night of May 22, 2010. The al Qaeda official wrote that Yazid was staying at the house of a \"well-known\" supporter of al Qaeda when a drone started making \"distinctive loops that we all know and all the brothers have experienced. They all know that if a plane starts doing these turns, it is going to strike.\" Yazid and his wife and three daughters and granddaughter were all killed in the drone strike, according to the official. The official lamented that drones are \"still circling our skies every day\" and the only relief from them came when weather conditions worsened and there was cloud cover. The official wrote but \"then they come back when the sky is clear.\" Al Qaeda had tried to use jamming technology and to hack into the drones \"but no result so far,\" according to the al Qaeda official. Underlining al Qaeda's weakness, during the summer of 2010 the group was contemplating some kind of ceasefire with the Pakistani government and had entered into negotiations with it via intermediaries to explain that al Qaeda's battle was \"primarily against the Americans. You became part of the battle when you sided with the Americans. If you were to leave us and our affairs alone, we would leave you alone.\" Highlights of bin Laden documents released in 2012 . The documents show that such a ceasefire was purely tactical rather than the beginning of some kind of rapprochement between al Qaeda and the Pakistanis. At one point an al Qaeda official referred to \"bin Laden's call to jihad against the apostate government of Pakistan.\" Apostasy is a grave crime in Islam and punishable by death in the eyes of members of al Qaeda. According to the documents, Pakistani intelligence officials \"reached out to\" al Qaeda through longtime jihadist sympathizers who had formerly held positions in the Pakistani intelligence agency, ISI, as well as the leaders of militant groups such as the Haqqani Taliban faction that have contacts with the ISI. The documents suggest that nothing came of these discussions, and there is no evidence in them that the Pakistanis had any idea that bin Laden was in Pakistan or indeed was even alive. Bergen in 2013: Bin Laden's life on the run . Moreover during the course of reporting the book \"Manhunt,\" about the CIA's long search for bin Laden, I spoke to several senior U.S. officials who said that the U.S. intelligence community was covertly monitoring the communications of Pakistani army chief Ashfaq Parvez Kayani and ISI director Ahmed Shuja Pasha the night of the bin Laden raid and they were both surprised about him being in Abbottabad. The documents did show one area of real success for al Qaeda, which was kidnapping for ransom, a tactic ISIS has been using so effectively. In 2008, al Qaeda had captured Afghanistan's former ambassador to Pakistan, Abdul Khaliq Farahi. After two years of negotiations he was exchanged for $5 million. An al Qaeda official told bin Laden that some of this money would be a \"gift\" to him \"from all the brothers.\" Bin Laden cautioned al Qaeda's leaders to be careful with the ransom money, as it might have to last the terrorist group several years. The documents show that al Qaeda's leaders were in contact with Tayeb Agha, a close aide to Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar. Agha has met with U.S. officials on a number of occasions to discuss peace negotiations. 2011: How U.S. forces killed Osama bin Laden . Far from the image of the isolated man in the cave that was prevalent before he was killed, the documents portray bin Laden as a hands-on manager of al Qaeda. In a 10-page letter that bin Laden wrote in August 2010, he had reams of advice for the al Qaeda-aligned group Al-Shabaab in Somalia, ordering that the group not attack Sufi Muslims in Somalia and also suggesting a plan to assassinate the President of neighboring Uganda who had sent his troops to fight Al-Shabaab. Bin Laden gave detailed notes about how Al-Shabaab could raise its agricultural output by using small dams for irrigation, and he suggested planting palm olive trees imported from Indonesia. He also advised Al-Shabaab against cutting down too many trees because it is \"dangerous for the environment of the region.\" Bin Laden had lived in nearby Sudan in the mid-'90s, establishing a number of business and farming enterprises. Bin Laden, something of a micromanager, told his top lieutenant to \"send us the resumes of all the brothers who may be nominated now or in the future for important management positions.\" He also cautioned against sending any emails, including even encrypted ones, urging that hand-delivered letters were the only safe method of communication. Bergen on 2012 documents: Seized documents show delusional leader and micromanager . Bin Laden also ordered that some of the tens of thousands of documents leaked by U.S. Army Pvt. Bradley Manning to WikiLeaks in 2010 be translated so that al Qaeda could better understand \"the enemy's policies in the region.\" And he suggested that his lieutenants reach out to Ahmed Zaidan, an Al Jazeera reporter based in Pakistan who had interviewed bin Laden in the past, so that he could have plenty of time to prepare a report to mark the 10th anniversary of 9/11. Bin Laden said he didn't want Zaidan to interview any members of his family, but he told his team to get in touch with the reporter \"promptly\" to get a sense of the questions he wanted bin Laden to answer. Bin Laden was killed four months before the 10th anniversary of 9/11. As the new al Qaeda documents make clear he died knowing that his dream of another terrorism spectacular in the West was just that: a dream. And the organization that he had founded was in deep trouble because of the CIA drone program. Note: An earlier version of this article incorrectly said bin Laden had lived in Somalia.",

Photos show water trickling into the aisle (left) and newspapers that were used to soak up the mess (right) The 27-year-old office worker told MailOnline Travel: \u2018After two hours, myself and other passengers noticed water seeping out from under the two lavatories closest to our seats. \u2018We complained to the air steward who took no notice at first but once the overflow become more obvious, he realised we were not over exaggerating. \u2018He then told us that the water was overflowing from the toilet and sink in both lavatories, so you can imagine the smell that we then had to endure for the remainder of the flight.\u2019 She added: \u2018It was quite difficult to tell whether the liquid contained human waste, but it would not surprise me as \u2026 the liquid overflowing from the lavatories definitely had a foul urine-like smell.\u2019 Passengers were forced to cover their mouths and noses with scarves or clothing to escape the stench. However, the airline claims the water was simply leaking from sinks. Passengers used articles of clothing to cover their mouths and noses as water flowed into the cabin . In an attempt to cover the smell a flight attendant sprayed the wet patches with an air freshener. Amrita said: \u2018This then led to complaints from a nearby passenger who suffered from asthma and couldn't be near such a strong fragrance without risking an asthma attack. \u2018After this, the flight attendant went back to check on the lavatories and almost gagged when he opened the door so I can only imagine the state of the toilets.\u2019 Amrita said the situation became worse over the course of the flight last month as the toilet and sink in the lavatory on the opposite side of the plane began to overflow as well. Passengers were forced to endure the stench for about six hours as they travelled from Delhi to London . She said she lodged a complaint on Twitter after returning to London, and the Mumbai-based airline offered an apology. She complained again and was offered a 2,000-point credit for Jet Airways\u2019 frequent flyer club. She wasn\u2019t satisfied with the offer, saying: \u2018Personally, I have no intention to ever fly with Jet Airways again after that experience. A spokesperson for Jet Airways told MailOnline Travel: 'Jet Airways regrets any inconvenience caused to guests on board flight 9W122 DEL - LHR dt.,Feb 15, 2015, on account of reverse drainage from the sinks on board the aircraft. 'As per our investigation, the overflow was only of water from the sink. All human waste is carried by separate system and lines which functioned normally during the flight.' Jet Airways investigated the incident and maintains the liquid leaking was coming from the sinks . Ms Jaurre said: \u2018Ideally, I would like compensation from Jet Airways because I feel that their offer of frequent flyer miles isn't sufficient, given that I was already quite ill on the flight and it didn't help then having to sit in that unhygienic and filthy cabin. \u2018I'm unsure if any other passengers became ill but as the liquid continued to overflow and the smell became more evident, it gave me a very bad headache and made me nauseous which put me off my in-flight meal.\u2019 She added: \u2018I became quite ill after the flight with a combination of throat infection, ear infection and stomach pains and had to take a week off from work to get better. Whether these were a direct result of the situation on-board, I cannot say but it definitely didn't help.\u2019 She is seeking monetary compensation plus a refund to cover the cost of the ticket. \u2018Nobody should ever have to sit through such disgusting in-flight conditions and the right checks should have been made to the aircraft to ensure things like this shouldn't have happened.\u2019",

But although time has finally been called on Portland Airport's cult carpet, fans of the post-modern rug are still queuing up to say a fond farewell. Not only does the picture-perfect pile has its own Facebook page (with almost 13,000 likes), Instagram account, and numerous twitter pages filled with thousand of images of Jon Schleuning's iconic design, it has also inspired a range of Adidas trainers, poems, as well as countless mugs and T-shirts. Scroll down for video . At the last count. there were more than 42,000 foot selfies of the colourful carpet \u00a0at PDX on Instagram . And last Friday, it was announced that a fragment of the carpet - which is in the process of being replaced - will have a staring role as the grand marshall in Portland's annual Starlight Parade in May. 'We get it, he is a carpet,' Starlight Parade chairman Jeff Deering told Katu.com. 'But most importantly, that carpet represents the hundreds and thousands of employees that work directly for and indirectly for the Portland International Airport. The airport brings in $9.6 billion of economic boon to our state.' 'It's Portland, we keep it weird,' he added. Fans of the carpet shared their delight on social media. Greg Koenig (@gak_pdx) wrote on twitter: 'Portland just made a chunk of carpet the grand marshall of a city parade. That\u2019s why I live here!', while Selena Larson (@selenalarson) commented: 'I hope one day to love something or someone as much as Portland loves its airport.' Its striking geometric pattern, by architects SRG Partnership, was something of a departure from the standard oatmeal carpets in 1980's airports . It's difficult to say what's worse here; the carpet of the flip flops and socks combo . Unusually for a floor covering, the carpet has amassed loyal following since it was first laid in the late 1980s . At the last count, there were more than 42,000 foot selfies of the colourful carpet on Instagram alone using the hashtag #pdxcarpet. Its striking geometric pattern, by architects SRG Partnership, was something of a departure from the standard oatmeal carpets in 1980's airports, and was carefully designed to reflect the spirit of the northwest. 'Seeing the carpet means I'm home,' said one tweeter, Cindy Wilson (@mscynthialou), while Schleuning himself has said, 'people love coming back to Portland. The carpet represents home.' Unusually for a floor covering, the carpet has amassed loyal following since it was first laid in the late 1980s . The geometric design also corresponds to Portland's intersecting North-South runways, as seen from the airport's control tower. But if you haven't managed to capture your own foot selfie with the distinctive carpet yet, there's still time. Airport authorities expect the removal of 13 acres of carpet will take about a year. The carpet is treated to being walked on by some pretty new pumps here .",

        "document": "Kevin de Bruyne scored twice to put Wolfsburg in control of their Europa League tie with Inter, before the former Chelsea star jumped into the crowd to conduct the celebrations. De Bruyne produced a brilliantly display on the pitch, and then led the Wolfsburg supporters in their post-match chanting, as the German side came from behind to give themselves an excellent chance of progress. Rodrigo Palacio had put the visitors ahead after just five minutes, but Inter struggled to defend what should have been a valuable away goal, and Naldo powered a header home to equalise after half an hour from a De Bruyne corner. Rodrigo Palacio wheels away in celebration after scoring an early away goal for Inter in Germany . The Argentine is mobbed by his team-mates as Inter took the lead on the counter, against the run of play . Brazilian defender Naldo powers a header at goal, and the pace he put on the ball beat\u00a0Juan Pablo Carrizo . Kevin de Bruyne added two goals in the second half to put the German club in control of the tie .

Subs not used:\u00a0Handanovic, Andreolli, Dodo, Puscas. Booked: D'Ambrosio, Ranocchia, Icardi, Vidic . Goal: Palacio . Referee: Szymon Marciniak (Poland) And in the second half De Bruyne, formerly of Chelsea, stole the show, finding the net from a neat cut-back and then an excellent free kick, although both goals owed much to the poor goalkeeping of\u00a0Juan Pablo Carrizo. The Belgian's first goal came after Vierinha had seized on a poor clearance from the Inter keeper, surged into the box, and crossed perfectly for De Bruyne to slide home. Then, with 15 minutes to go, the former Chelsea forward's free kick snuck past Carrizo, despite it being aimed at the side of the goal he was meant to be covering. De Bruyne could easily have completed a hat-trick, but he shot wide when through on goal in the closing stages, with only Carrizo to beat. Wolfsburg showed that they could continue their good form without goals from Europe's hottest striker at the moment, Bas Dost. The Dutchman was well below his best before he was replaced midway through the second half by Niklas Bendtner, but De Bruyne took up the slack. Inter, meanwhile, under former Manchester City boss Roberto Mancini, were poor for large periods of the game, offering little going forward, and unable to keep up the defensive solidity they had shown in the first half once they began to tire in the second 45. De Bryune decided to conduct his own chanting with the Wolfsburg supporters after their win . The team clap the fans behind one goal after De Bryune's amusing antics .

        "document": "Armed with a sharp sense of smell, dogs have a long history of detecting explosives for their human handlers, and soon there could be sniffer elephants too. Researchers have found that the large mammals excel at identifying explosives by smell, stirring speculation about whether their extraordinary ability could save lives. Elephants could be used to detect land mines in areas that have seen conflict and could even do so at a distance with the aid of drones. Researchers have found that elephants excel at identifying explosives by smell, stirring speculation about whether their extraordinary ability could save lives. A stock image is shown . The research was conducted in South Africa and involved the U.S. military. On a game reserve co-owned by Sean Hensman, three elephants passed the smell tests. Sniffing at buckets, they were rewarded with a treat of marula - a tasty fruit - when they showed that they recognised samples of TNT by raising a front leg. \u2018They work it out very, very quickly,\u2019 he said. Stephen Lee, head scientist at the US Army Research Office, which backed the study financially, said that elephants remember their training longer than dogs. Elephants could be used to detect land mines in areas that have seen conflict and could even do so at a distance with the aid of drones. This image shows an a warning sign in an area littered with explosives . Last summer, researchers confirmed that African elephants have the best sense of smell in the animal kingdom. Scientists from the University of Tokyo said elephants have the largest number of genes dedicated to smell of any mammal. They have 2,000 genes that are dedicated to scent - twice as many as dogs and five times as many as humans. Previous studies have shown that the animals have well-developed olfactory systems that include large olfactory bulbs and areas in the brain. They seem to be able to distinguish between two Kenyan ethnic groups\u2014the Maasai, who spear elephants to demonstrate strength, and the Kamba, who pose little threat to the animals. The ability of elephants to detect explosives was first noticed in Angola - a country that many elephants had returned to after a 2002 peace deal ended a protracted war. While there was peace, the land remained sown with mine fields. Some elephants seemed to intentionally avoid them, though it might not have been a scent that kept them away - they could instead have associated those areas with danger because elephants had died there in the past. Researchers decided to investigate and in Bela-Bela, a town north of the South African capital of Pretoria, elephants named Shan, Mussina and Chishuru were administered smelling tests. The elephants detected TNT samples 73 out of the 74 times that they encountered in a line of buckets, according to Ashadee Kay Miller, a zoology student at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. They only got this wrong 3.6 per cent of the time over 502 buckets that contained the explosive, which was dissolved in acetone on filter paper. In an experiment conducted at a game reserve, elephants (stock image) sniffed at buckets some of which contained TNT. They were rewarded with a treat of marula - a fruit - when they showed that they recognised samples of TNT by raising a front leg. The creatures have the best sense of smell in the animal kingdom . All other buckets were filled with acetone and filter paper only. In a second set of tests, the elephants scored 100 percent, detecting TNT in 23 out of 23 buckets when \u2018distractor odours\u2019 such as tea, bleach, soap and gasoline were placed in the other buckets, she said. However, in the real world, making an elephant walk around a mine field would not only put the animal in danger, but would be impractical too. To overcome this problem, unmanned drones could collect scent samples from mined areas and bring them to a trained elephant, which would smell them and alert handlers to any sign of explosives, Mr Hensman said. The elephants detected TNT samples 73 out of the 74 times that they encountered its odour in a line of buckets, and could be used to sniff out landmines from a distance. Here, a member of\u00a0Thailand's First Humanitarian Mine Action Unit uses a mine detecting dog to search for land mines . Another possibility would be to replicate an elephant\u2019s sense of smell and incorporate it into electronic sensors that detect dangerous materials, building on research with dogs and rats, Mr Lee said. He revealed that researchers are thinking of designing a sensor based on an elephant trunk, which puffs out air to stir up an area, and then sucks in air to smell. Florida International University participated in the initial research, and it was done on a \u2018shoestring\u2019 budget with volunteers. The findings of the experiment did not surprise George Wittemyer, an assistant professor at Colorado State University, who was not involved in the study. Research last year revealed that elephants have the best sense of smell in the animal kingdom, partially because they have\u00a02,000 genes that are dedicated to scent. \u2018Their world is primarily olfactory,\u2019 he Professor Wittemyer said. \u2018The sensitivity is recognised as being unparalleled.\u2019 The experiment comes as elephant populations across Africa are threatened. Poachers across the continent have annually killed tens of thousands of elephants for their tusks in recent years because of a surge in demand for ivory in Asia, primarily China. Mine-detecting rats: Giant African pouched rats are being used in Africa to locate landmines and help diagnose tuberculosis thanks to their acute sense of smell. Some of the creatures are trained by the charity Apopo and are used to detect explosives in Tanzania and Mozambique, which has many unexploded mines after decades of civil war. Giant African pouched rats are being used in Africa to locate landmines and help diagnose tuberculosis thanks to their acute sense of smell (pictured) Bomble bees:\u00a0In 2013, a team of scientists trained bees to sniff out explosives. The idea at the time was to house them in a hand detector, which could be used to sense a chemical in airports, for example. The bees were trained by exposing them to the scent that was detected while dangling a sugary drink in front of them. The insects, which stick out their tongues to get the sweet treat, quickly learned to associate the smell of the explosive or chemical with food. A trial was run at Heathrow Airport. 'Sniffer bees' have also been reared to detect landmines in the Balkans. The bees, which French and Croatian biologists say have an olfactory sense as good as dogs, will search out mines left by soldiers in the 1990s. Nearly 120,000 of the unexploded devices remain in more than 9,400 carefully marked minefields.",

Trooper Mark Tackett of the Texas Department of Public Safety said the engine and propeller came off the plane, which struck another home before the plane landed in a backyard. Lunsford says two adults and two children were injured. Scroll down for video . One woman passenger was flown to hospital and another man was seriously injured after a Beechcraft B35 crashed into a backyard in Gordonville, Texas, near the border with Oklahoma.

        "document": "Three retired carers\u00a0are accused of running a child sex ring for 30 years at a school for vulnerable children where 'abuse was almost the norm', a court has heard. Colwyn Baker, David Hennessy and Nigel Putman are said to have preyed on youngsters at the now defunct Swaylands School in Penshurst, Kent, between 1963 and 1993. As well as the abuse allegedly committed by the trio, jurors were also told Baker allegedly encouraged the boys to commit sex acts on other children. David\u00a0Hennessey (pictured left) and Nigel Putman (right) are accused alongside Colwyn Baker of sexually abusing youngsters at the now-defunct Swaylands School in Penshurst, Kent, between 1963 and 1993 . The three men face a total of 49 charges against 24 victims, who were aged between 10 to 15 at the time. Baker, 71, of Morningside, Edinburgh, faces 24 counts of indecent assault and three charges of rape. Hennessy, 74, of  King's Lynn, Norfolk, has been charged with 17 counts of indecent assault, one of gross indecency with a child and one of rape. Putman, 62, of  Slough, Berkshire, faces three charges of indecent assault. They deny all of the charges against them. The men were residential child care officers at Swaylands School, which catered for boys with emotional and behavioural difficulties and which closed in 1993. They are accused of making nightly rounds and encouraging the pupils to abuse each other in a number of cruel and sometimes painful sexual 'games' - keeping them quiet with blackmail and presents. The men were residential child care officers at Swaylands School (pictured) which catered for boys with emotional and behavioural difficulties. The school closed in 1993 and has since been converted in to flats . The court heard detailed descriptions of multiple counts of alleged sexual abuse, including a sex 'game' called 'toothpaste testicles'. Opening the 12-week trial at Maidstone Crown Court today, prosecutor Philip Bennetts QC told the jury: 'The atmosphere at the school at the time that you are considering was one where abuse was almost the norm. 'Children who were abused were positively encouraged to abuse other pupils. 'Abuse and the age of pupils abused led some pupils to consider that there was nothing wrong with abusing other pupils.' One of Baker's alleged victims became so scared that he often stayed awake at night, sleeping in stairwells to avoid Baker, Mr Bennetts said. As a result, the boy would often fall asleep in class, causing a dramatic decline in his learning. He would end up being caned by the headmaster as punishment for dozing off. The court heard another boy said Baker would wake him in the middle of the night and abuse him almost nightly for three years. Another told investigators that Baker was in charge of the Scouts, karate and swimming, adding: 'Anything good that you wanted to do as a boy, Baker was in charge of it.' Baker allegedly told the boy that he had a small penis because he did not 'exercise it' enough with other boys. Mr Bennett said the boy resisted for a long time but Baker made sure no one spoke to him, until he eventually 'caved in' and allowed others to 'do it'. Hennessy allegedly abused one boy on his first or second night at Swaylands, and told his victim: 'It's not worth crying, it won't help you,' jurors heard. The 12-week trial into historic child sex abuse at the school is being held at Maidstone Crown Court (pictured) The boy told police that Hennessy abused him from the age of 10 until he was 13 or 14, when he stopped as new boys came in and he was 'getting too old'. Victims said they were targeted when they were at their 'weakest', while going to sleep, jurors heard. Mr Bennetts said one boy revealed that Baker's most effective 'blackmail' tool was not allowing him to go home at the weekend. Mr Bennetts said one boy was abused for three years on a nightly basis by Hennessy while he was at the junior school.\u00a0When the boy moved to the senior school, his care worker was Baker who allegedly continued sexually abused him until he was 16. Putman was said to have tried to molest one boy while he was in the shower. When the boy told Putman to back off, he put his arms round the boy 'like a lover', Mr Bennetts said. Mr Bennetts told the court that one victim, aged around seven or eight, remembers Hennessy buying him presents to keep quiet, including an orange Donald Duck hat and ski goggles. One victim said after Baker sexually abused him for the first time he felt 'confused and upset'. Mr Bennetts said: 'The victim quickly realised he would only be allowed to watch TV and do nice things that boys wanted to do, in return for sexual acts. Mr Bennetts told the jury that Baker was convicted in 1994 of four counts of indecent assault on a boy aged under 16 and one count of gross indecency. He also disclosed that Hennessy was convicted in December 1993 of four counts of indecent assault on a boy and two sex offences against a pupil. The trial was adjourned by Judge Philip Statman to 10.30am tomorrow morning. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.",

Vienna has the best quality of living overall, according to the Mercer 2015 Quality of Living rankings, which analyses 230 countries globally. Overall, European cities dominated the top 10, with Zurich, Munich and Dusseldorf leading the pack. For those looking to emigrate, Vienna, Austria, offers the highest quality of life, according to a new survey . Auckland, New Zealand, comes in third among the major cities with Vancouver, Canada, the highest-ranking city in North America, rounding out the top five. Vancouver is the region's only city in the top 10. Singapore is the highest-ranking Asian city, while Dubai ranks first across Middle East and Africa. Montevideo, Uruguay, takes top spot among South American cities. Mercer's Quality of Living rankings analysed 230 cities globally, considering political stability and crime rates .

Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo . 9. Conakrey, Guinea . 10.Nouakchott, Mauritania . Among the top ranked cities for quality of life is beautiful Zurich, Switzerland, which came in second . The study finds that Western Europe continues to offer a stable working environment for those who relocate there, accounting for seven of the top 10 cities listed. Vienna, ranked first both in Europe and worldwide, takes top honours, but Zurich, Munich, Dusseldorf and Frankfurt all offer workers the chance for equally happy, full lives. Cities in Central and Eastern Europe, however, have a wider range of quality-of-living standards. Among the highest ranking cities? Prague, Budapest and Ljubljana in Slovenia. The region's lower ranking cities include Tirana, Minsk and Kiev, which has experienced a considerable drop following political instability and violence in Ukraine. Of the top 10 most livable cities, Germany is home to three: Munich (pictured), Dusseldorf, and Frankfurt . In the UK, London is the highest-ranked city, followed by Birmingham and Glasgow. 1. London . 2. Birmingham . 3. Glasgow . 4. Aberdeen . 5. Belfast . 'UK cities overall enjoy high standards of quality of living and remain stable and attractive locations for businesses,' another Principal at Mercer explains. In North America, Canada and the United States offer plenty of attractive relocation options, with Vancouver rounding out the top five worldwide. Headed to the United States? Consider San Francisco, Boston and Honolulu when deciding where to settle, as all are ranked among Mercer's top 50 cities worldwide.

Berlin . In the Pacific, New Zealand and Australian cities are some of the highest ranked, with Auckland the only entry from the region to make it to the top five. Sydney does round out the top 10 and Wellington is close behind in 12th place. But when it comes to the Middle East and Africa, Dubai is the highest ranked in the 74th spot. Emerging city Durban in South Africa is also ranked quite highly, mainly due to its high-quality housing, recreational offerings and readily available consumer goods. Baghdad is the lowest-ranking city in the region and in the survey, overall. Auckland in New Zealand ranked third for quality of life, according to the survey from Mercer . Auckland's bustling city, situated in the middle of lush greenery, offers outdoor lovers the ultimate mix . Baghdad was the lowest ranked city both in the Middle East and Africa region and also globally . Mercer's annual Quality of Living survey is conducted to help multinational companies and other employers compensate employees fairly when assigning them to international destinations. Admittedly, the survey focuses most on established and emerging business-focused cities and those with financial centres. 'Taking a short or long-term work assignment to a new country is both an exciting and challenge experience for employees and their families,' says Slagin Parakatil, Principal at Mercer. 'Cultures, societies and comparatively different climates, as well as political instability, high crime rates and poor infrastructure can be difficult to navigate and settle down in. 'Employers need to assess whether their staff and families will encounter any drop in quality of living and ensure they are fairly compensated for it.'",

        "document": "Williams driver Valtteri Bottas has been warned by the FIA he must stop driving the moment he suffers a repeat of the back pain that forced him out of the Australian Grand Prix. Bottas sustained a very small tear in the annular part of a disc in his lower back during qualifying, leading to severe pain. Although the Finn made himself available to drive on Sunday morning ahead of the race, the FIA ultimately declared him unfit. Valtteri Bottas briefs the press about his injury at the Sepang Circuit Medical Centre on Thursday . Bottas declared himself fit for Melbourne after suffering a back injury in qualifying, but still missed the race . Ahead of Sunday's race in Malaysia, Bottas has now been given the all clear, albeit with the proviso from the FIA that 'in case of a recurrence of pain, or any abnormal feeling, he must stop at the earliest opportunity'. Bottas has no doubt he will come through unscathed as he said: 'The back is good, no pain, which is nice. 'At the end of last week I could do something without any pain, and during the weekend I could swim, cross-train without any pain, so the recovery was really good. 'We've done everything we can in this short period of time - luckily there are two weeks - so I feel confident of getting back in the car.' Bottas has revealed the injury was due to his brake and seat position inside his car, which have since been corrected. 'The back is now in a more neutral position, less pressure on the discs. We are confident that should be it,' added Bottas. Preparations are ramping up in Kuala Lumpur ahead of the Malaysian Grand Prix . Mercedes director Toto Wolff (right) speaks with Bottas in the paddock in Kuala Lumpur . 'I've never had any problems before with the lower back. That kind of thing normally takes a bit of time to build up. 'But there was no warning, it went suddenly under maximum braking. It was like someone putting a knife in there, with the pain ramping up through to midnight. 'During the night it started to ease off. In the morning I would have been ready to race. 'I did pass the tests, but the FIA had access to all the material from the hospital, from the MRI and that stuff. 'Maybe they thought it was better (not to race) in the longer term, which could have been true. 'It was very disappointing, but I also respect the FIA's decision, with the support great from the team.' As a precaution, Williams on Thursday announced Adrian Sutil as their reserve driver, with the German back in Formula One after being axed by Sauber at the end of last year. Although Susie Wolff is test driver and young Briton Alex Lynn the development driver, Williams believe experience is crucial should a sudden change be required. Sir Frank Williams said: 'The fight for a top constructors' championship position will be intense this season. 'Therefore we have selected a driver with recent race experience and are confident if the need arose, he would be a solid pair of hands to race the FW37 and assist our 2015 campaign.'",

After dismissing Ireland for 249 with an over to spare when their spinners established a stranglehold on the top-order batting, Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan played themselves in for a token couple of overs. They then launched a full-blooded attack, alternating flowing drives with explosive pulls while also pushing around the ball for comfortable singles. Shikhar Dhawan celebrates reaching his century as India comfortably beat Ireland at the World Cup . The Indian opener scored exactly 100 from 119 balls at Seddon Park in Hamilton . Virat Kohli is congratulated by captain MS Dhoni after steering India to an eight-wicket victory . Ireland's Stuart Thompson celebrates after bowling Rohit Sharma for 64 runs . Sharma knocks the ball away for a single during India's run chase in Hamilton . Dhawan was dropped on five when John Mooney failed to hold a fierce caught-and-bowled chance. After scoring five further runs he was dropped again off the unlucky Mooney, this time at backward point when captain William Porterfield parried a stinging cut but was unable to hang on to the rebound. Those were the only times the Irish bowlers looked like taking a wicket and the duo took the score to 174 when Sharma chopped medium pacer Stuart Thompson on to his stumps and was out for 64 from 66 balls. With the Indian supporters making a tremendous din, Dhawan took a single to complete his eighth one-day century from 84 balls with five sixes but was then caught off the following ball he faced from Thompson. Virat Kohli (44 not out) and Ajinkya Rahane (33 not out) took their team to victory with 13.1 overs to spare. Porterfield elected to bat on a warm afternoon before a capacity crowd of 11,000 packed into a picturesque ground in New Zealand's fourth largest city and all seemed set fair for the Irish when the captain and Paul Stirling put on 89 for the first wicket from 15 overs. Mahendra Singh Dhoni turned to his spinners and Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja and Suresh Raina responded by first frustrating then dismissing the Irish batsmen who found boundaries hard to come by after the initial flurry. Stirling (42) lofted a simple catch to long-off off Ashwin's bowling and Ed Joyce was bowled for two trying to cut a ball from Raina which was too full for the shot. Dhawan hits the ball away to the boundary for four runs on his way to a century . John Mooney drops a catch off Rohit Sharma as India chased down the 260 required for victory . Ireland opener William Porterfield marks his half-century as his team posted 259 in their innings . Niall O'Brien top scored for Ireland with 75 off 85 balls . The Irish opener Porterfield drives the ball as Indian wicketkeeper MS Dhoni watches on . Porterfield was reduced to pushing the ball for singles and was finally caught for 67 skying the ball while trying to accelerate. Niall O'Brien was the top scorer with 75 including three sixes, one of which was helped over the boundary rope by Mohammed Shami leaping high to try to take the catch. O'Brien, swinging vigorously to the leg side, kept the scoreboard moving but wickets fell regularly at the other end, including that of the dangerous Kevin O'Brien who was caught behind for one from a thin edge off Shami.

Marc were more kind to the rest of the Real players, claiming Madrid 'overwhelmed Barca for 45 minutes, don\u2019t finish them off and end up against the ropes'. Both papers also feature Spaniards playing in England on their front pages, with Juan Mata's spectacular volley at Anfield, and Diego Costa's withdrawal from the Spain squad, making the headlines.

Mundo Deportivo highlight Barcelona's four point lead at the top of La Liga, while Sport call it a 'blow to Madrid' In Italy the focus was on Carlos Tevez, who scored a stunning goal to keep Juventus winning.

Despite temperatures reaching -50C, the excitable cubs played in the snow - even during a blizzard - rolling around and climbing on top of their mother. Photographer Andy Skillen tracked down the family at Wapusk National Park in Manitoba, Canada, and followed the family for two days. Welcome to the world: A mother Polar bear introduces her two newborn cubs to the joys of playing in the snow . Tumble: It takes time to learn to keep your balance! Wildlife photographer Andy Skillen spent two days following the bears at Wapusk National Park in Manitoba, Canada . Drowsy: According to Mr Skillen, the polar bears had recently resurfaced after spending the winter in hibernation . The area is famous for its polar bear dens, and Mr Slkillen managed to capture a set of heart-warming scenes. In the region, most polar bears build their dens around November and come out of hibernation in February. The photographer said that most bears in the park, hungry after months of being in their dens, are anxious to get hunting seals before the spring thaw. Having excitable young bears in tow, though, makes things a little trickier. He said: 'It's a fascinating scene to watch unfold. 'Polar bears live in a world of extremes, and yet despite their fearsome reputation show a remarkably touching side. 'They are programmed to survive like no other animal on earth, and the sheer enormity of the tasks these mothers have to take on every couple of years is beyond belief. 'I have the utmost respect for all animals that can make a living in the Arctic, and bears top the lot.' Content: The family of bears was spotted in the Waspusk National Park in Manitoba, Canada . Bliss: The two young cubs, pictured, frolicked in the snow for several hours in temperatures of -50c . Love: The area is very famous for the number of polar bears who spend the winter hidden away in their dens . Protective: As soon as the young cubs take a few steps away their mother, she looks on intently . Cosy: The two young cubs use their mother as a form of protection from the worst of the elements . Safe: The cubs enjoyed their first taste of freedom but they never went too far from their protective mother . Hidden: The Polar Bear mother seemed completely oblivious to the presence of the wildlife photographer .",

Authorities say an Albuquerque man accused of shooting his ex-girlfriend on Tuesday told police his neighbor's dog told him to do it. KRQE-TV in Albuquerque reports that 48-year-old Matthew Gonzales told investigators that the dog gave him the advice after Gonzales saw his ex-girlfriend's status update on social media. Gonzales says he was angry about his ex-girlfriend announcing that she was single. According to court documents, Gonzales says the dog told him, 'you need to take care of this.' Police say Gonzales shot his ex-girlfriend during a struggle on Tuesday. According to court documents when police arrived they saw a woman lying on the ground with an apparent gunshot wound to her head. She was conscious when she arrived at the hospital and told the staff that her boyfriend arrived at her home that morning and was arguing with her. She then told police that because her family was at her home at the time she got into a car to discuss things with her ex-boyfriend so as not to upset them. She says that he drove her short distance and the next thing she remembered was that she was lying on the ground on the street. Court documents state that police discovered Matthew Gonzales at Legacy Church where he supposedly admitted to his pastor that he shot his ex-girlfriend. When police confronted Gonzales, he waived his Miranda Rights and said that his neighbour has a dog that communicates with him. He told police that he initially planned on ending his own life in front of his girlfriend so that she would 'know how he felt' about her single status on Facebook.

Police say Matthew told them that he drove to his sister's house to borrow a gun and he took the gun to his ex-girlfriend\u2019s house where he arrived unannounced. She and her 10-year-old daughter exited the house as he demanded and he insisted that his ex-girlfriend get into his car and that her daughter go to the neighbor's house. 'Don\u2019t make me drag you into the car,' he reportedly said. He allegedly pulled a gun from his pocket and his ex-girlfriend fearfully obliged.

The court document states that when the ex-girlfriend saw Gonzales staring into oncoming traffic she opened the door and tried to get out of the car. Gonzales, with a gun in his right pocket, allegedly tried to grab her and he also discharged his gun one time. She fell to the ground. He then allegedly drove to the Mesa to commit suicide but after calling his boss he was advised to talk to his pastor. Gonzales faces a number of charges, including kidnapping and aggravated battery. He is being held on a $150,000 bond. It was not known if he had an attorney.",

        "document": "A sister who lost her brother in the Afghan War has married the soldier who tried in vain to save his life. Private Gregg Stone, 20, was shot dead on 3rd June 2012, while on a mission to rescue an Afghan policeman kidnapped by the Taliban. Liam Fisher, 22,  tried valiantly to save his comrade, and was lucky to survive himself after a bullet hit his helmet as he dragged his dying friend into a ditch, before lying on top of him to protect him. Rosie-Ann Stone has married Private Liam Fisher, who risked his own life trying to save her fatally injured brother in Afghanistan . But he could not be saved, and the young soldier died of his wounds at the scene. His sister Rosie-Ann Stone, of Atwick, near Hornsea, East Yorkshire, heard of Pte Fisher's bravery at her brother's inquest and the couple stayed in touch by exchanging Facebook messages. They soon realised they were falling for each other and the couple got engaged last November. The Archbishop of York, Dr John Sentamu, was so moved by the story of the family that he granted a special licence for the couple to marry in York Minster in a moving ceremony held yesterday. Leading the service yesterday, the Revd Canon Michael Smith, Pastor of the Minster, told the 40 guests: . 'I know some of you have been to some really dark and painful places. Love is about being prepared to make sacrifices for the person or people we love. Private Gregg Stone (left), 20, was shot dead on 3rd June 2012, while on a mission to rescue an Afghan policeman kidnapped by the Taliban. \u00a0The Stone family were struck by tragedy again when Rosie-Ann's sister, Jennie, 28, (right) was killed in a car crash . 'We remember those unable to come here today and are not here. We remember in God's presence Gregg and Jennie. 'We remember those lines that \"Love never dies\". 'We remember them and all our loved ones who have died as they share with is this day and our prayers.' The Stone family were struck by tragedy again when Rosie-Ann's sister, Jennie, 28, was killed in a car crash in Fraisthorpe. Rosie-Ann was involved in the fatal incident and prosecuted for causing death through careless driving, but was later unanimously acquitted by a jury at Hull Crown Court. Rosie-Ann said before the wedding: 'We are so happy. Gregg would be giddy. He would be shocked, but he'd be so pleased. Mum and Dad say they feel as though Gregg sent Liam to me.

Mum and Dad say they feel as though Gregg sent Liam to me' Rosie-Ann and Liam met at Gregg's inquest in Hull in May 2013. After exchanging Facebook messages, the couple had their first date . 'When we got together, people were sceptical. 'People thought, \"Is she just looking for comfort?\" or \"Is she just looking for a replacement brother?\" 'But our relationship is founded on merit. I love Liam for everything he is. He is genuine. 'People contact you when there is tragedy, saying they'll support you. Liam was different. 'He just wanted to get to know me. It was really refreshing.' Rosie-Ann and Liam met at Gregg's inquest in Hull in May 2013. After exchanging Facebook messages, the couple had their first date in Bridlington the following August. Pte Fisher at first did not even tell his new love about his Task Force Helmand commander's bravery commendation for trying to save her brother. Describing Gregg's final moments, he said: 'It was chaos. It was jungle. You couldn't see anything. 'The platoon commander told us to keep 10m apart, but I turned to Gregg and said, 'It's 5m for me and you'. Then the rounds came flying.' He added: 'I'm sure Gregg would have sat me down and grilled me. He would have told me to look after his little sister, but he would be pleased.' Rosie-Ann's parents said they were over the moon when the engagement was announced. Her father Bob said: 'I can't put into words, without getting overwhelmed and emotional, how I feel', while mother Angie added: 'We feel we have gained a son.'",

        "document": "After a six-month hiatus from golf over alleged cocaine and alcohol abuse, Dustin Johnson appears to be back on form. On Sunday the 30-year-old claimed victory at the elite World Golf Championships-Cadillac Championships in Miami, telling reporters that fatherhood was behind his improved focus. Following his win, Johnson was greeted at the 18th hole on the Trump National Doral course by his model\u00a0fianc\u00e9e Paulina Gretzky - daughter of former NHL great Wayne - and their son Tatum, who was born in January. The new parents shared a passionate kiss in front of\u00a0cameras, while cradling their newborn between them. Gretzky described her husband-to-be as the 'best dad' and 'best friend' she could ever wish for. Scroll down for video . Passionate embrace: After claiming victory at the elite World Golf Championships-Cadillac Championships in Miami on Sunday, Dustin Johnson was greeted at the 18th hole by his family . Doting dad: He was overjoyed to see his model fianc\u00e9e Paulina Gretzky - daughter of former NHL great Wayne - and their son Tatum, who was born in January . Perfect match: The new parents shared a passionate kiss in front of cameras, while cradling their newborn between them . She continued to ABC News: 'He's been so supportive with me and we're just there for each other. I couldn't be happier for him.' Talking about how fatherhood had changed his life for the better, Johnson added: 'It's hard to describe, but just from the first day he's born, your perspective on life completely changes. 'Things that were important aren't important anymore. 'It kind of makes life a lot easier I think, just because there's just one thing that's kind of all you think about. It definitely simplifies stuff.' When Johnson announced his decision to step away from golf last July due to 'personal challenges', rumors about his lifestyle swirled, including the suggestion that he may have been suspended by the PGA Tour. Indeed, Golf.com reported that Johnson had failed three drug tests: one for marijuana in 2009 and two for cocaine, in 2012 and 2014. Johnson celebrates with Donald Trump as he holds the Gene Sarazen Cup after winning the WGC-Cadillac Championship WGC at Trump National in Doral . Career success: Johnson turned professional as a golfer in late 2007 in his early twenties . However, the Tour - which had initially said it did not comment on rumors or speculation - released a statement saying Johnson had taken a voluntary leave of absence and had not been suspended. And in a news conference on Sunday when if he had ever failed a Tour drugs test, Johnson replied: 'No. Thanks'. In a candid interview with Sports Illustrated this January, Johnson revealed that alcohol was his real vice. He said he would excessively drink and party to relieve stress, with his tipple of choice being Grey Goose, soda and lime. In a bid to get clean, Johnson said he took time out from sport and concentrated on home life. Bundle of joy: Johnson's son Tatum Gretzky Johnson was born on January 19 . Changed man: The golfer says fatherhood has helped him to put his bad boy party days behind him . Love birds: Johnson proposed to Gretzky in August 2013 - as of now, there are no reports of where and when a wedding will take place. Commenting on his time out, he said:\u00a0'I got to spend a lot of time with Paulina and help her as much as I could through her pregnancy, and then the birth of our son. 'I really enjoyed being able to be home and not having to leave or do anything. 'I was in the gym every single day, every morning, and then spend the rest of the time either I would go practice a little bit or just hanging out with Paulina.' Johnson returned to the green in Febuary at the Farmers Insurance Open in Torrey Pines. As he won big on Sunday night, the two most important people in Johnson's life were waiting for him. He concluded: 'Paulina and Tatum were waiting for me when I got done. That was the best part of the day for sure.' 'My game is in good form. I feel really confident in my golf swing. I need to do some work with the putter and short game, especially leading into Augusta.' Johnson proposed to Gretzky in August 2013. As of now, there are no reports of where and when a wedding will take place.",

        "document": "A carer who was caught on camera stealing money from a vulnerable pensioner's purse has been jailed. Sheryvone Brooks, 20, was filmed taking \u00a330 from 85-year-old Evelyn Nicholson after her suspicious employers installed a recording device in the elderly woman's home in\u00a0Stourbridge, West Midlands. A camera - hidden between an ornamental teapot and a box of water filters after the pensioner's money started going missing in December last year - captured crystal-clear footage of Brooks removing the purse from a kitchen drawer before taking out and pocketing the cash. Sheryvone Brooks was filmed taking \u00a330 out of Evelyn Nicholson's purse after the elderly woman's family installed a camera when they noticed money going missing from her home . A camera - hidden between an ornamental teapot and a box of water filters after the pensioner's home after money started going missing in December last year - captured crystal-clear footage . The footage shows Mrs Nicholas sitting in a chair with a cup of tea next to the drawers at her home. It then cuts to Brooks, who was 19 at the time, perched in the same chair and captures the moment she takes a look to see if he OAP is watching before quickly opening the drawer. She then calmly takes out a red purse and stands up before pinching cash and stuffing it in her tracksuit pocket. Brooks, of Sedgley, West Midlands, pleaded guilty to one count of theft at Dudley Magistrates Court on February 19. She wept in the dock as she was sentenced to 26 weeks in a Young Offenders' Institute at Wolverhampton Crown Court. Judge Martin Walsh told her: 'You're 20-years-old and fall to be sentenced for what was a mean and despicable offence of theft arriving out of a gross breach of trust. 'You, whilst inside her home address, stole \u00a330 from her purse. 'The aggravating feature here is not the value of property, it's the nature of the relationship between you and the elderly person whom you were responsible for providing care for. The footage shows Mrs Nicholas sitting in a chair with a cup of tea next to the drawers at her home. It then cuts to Brooks, who was 19 at the time, perched in the same chair and captures the moment she takes a look to see if he OAP is watching before quickly opening the drawer . She calmly takes out a red purse and stands up before pinching cash and stuffing it in her tracksuit pocket . 'The sentence is designed not only to punish you, it's also essential that other members of the profession which you are a part of understands that offences of this sort committed against vulnerable and elderly people in their home will result in an immediate prison sentence. 'It is a deterrent to others.' The court heard the pensioner's family became suspicious when money began going missing in December last year. Prosecutor Geoffrey Dann said Brooks admitted the offence to officers and said she had stolen the money in order to buy Christmas presents. Mr Dann added: 'Mrs Nicholson is 85-years-old. She lives alone and she is under the care of Gateway Health and Social Care. 'The defendant was one of the carers who visited Mrs Nicholson's home on a regular basis. 'Mrs Nicholson's family ensured that she had cash and she had some money in a purse which was kept in a drawer in the kitchen. 'They noticed that money seemed to go missing. They asked Mrs Nicholson if she had given it to anyone and she hadn't. 'On January 6 the company installed a camera with the family's permission. 'The defendant attended the address on that day and she can be seen to go to the drawer, to open the drawer and take out the purse. 'The defendant was spoken to by the deputy manager and she admitted she had stolen the money. 'She was interviewed by the police on January 15 and said she she needed the money for Christmas gifts. 'She showed remorse for her actions and wanted to pay the money back. The court heard the retired farm worker, who has 11 children, 16 grandchildren, 13 great-grandchildren and 11 great-great-grandchildren, fell ill as a result of the theft . 'Mrs Nicholson's son says in his statement this offence has made his mother very ill. 'The doctor has attended her twice since the theft, it has left her feeling very vulnerable.' Jason Aris, defending, said Brooks had faced 'embarrassment and shame' as a result of the CCTV footage of her theft being placed online. He added: 'She has shown considerable insight into her offending behaviour. 'She identified that her actions would have left the victim feeling vulnerable in her own house. 'The CCTV footage that captures her taken the money has ended up online. This has given her a certain sense of notoriety that she didn't seek to achieve. 'This has compounded her embarrassment and shame and family and friends across the other side of the country have learned about her escapades. 'By engaging in this stupid and thoughtless behaviour, she has pretty much ensured that any possibility of work in the future is going to be difficult for her. Brooks, of Sedgley, West Midlands, pleaded guilty to one count of theft at Dudley Magistrates Court on February 19 . She is filmed opening the drawer after looking around the room to see if anyone is watching her . 'She certainly won't be working in the care industry in the near future. 'The remorse that has been expressed by her is genuine. She has described the shame as all consuming.' Speaking outside court after the hearing, Mrs Nicholson's eldest son Robert Smith, 65 said around \u00a3200 had gone missing from his mother's purse in total. He said the retired farm worker, who has 11 children, 16 grandchildren, 13 great-grandchildren and 11 great-great-grandchildren, fell ill as a result of the theft. Mr Smith, who works as a courier, added: 'I'm pleased with the sentence, I was hoping she was going to go down. 'She was one of the primary carers and had been going in to my mother for six months. 'I knew it was a carer, they were the only people who could have taken the money out of the drawer, but I didn't know who it was. 'My mother was devastated and it has affected her health. 'She knows one of the carers has stolen from her but she wouldn't be able to tell you which one, we have tried to keep it away from her. 'She had to go into respite for a couple of weeks because it really upset her but she is back home now and she is settling back down. 'She can't walk, she can't stand without the assistance of the carers. 'She loves the carers and with their assistance that allows her to stop at home which is what she wants.' A spokesman for Gateway Health and Social Care Dudley confirmed Brooks had been dismissed.",

        "document": "Depraved mothers who gave up their lives in the West to live under the rule of Islamic State terrorists in Syria are taking photographs of their newborn children sleeping alongside handguns and assault rifles in a sickening game of one-upmanship on social media. Featuring titles such as 'The Little Terrorist' and 'Generation Kilafah', the chilling images show innocent children being forced to embrace their parents' extremism in ISIS' de facto capital Raqqa. While some shots feature children so young that they are unlikely to be aware of the significance of the photographs, another shows a masked young girl of around three-years-old dressed in full combat gear, carrying an AK47 and raising her index figure to make a well-known jihadi gesture. 'The Little Terrorist': A newborn baby is seen sleeping under a Hello Kitty blanket. The otherwise adorable photograph is ruined by the fact an AK47 machine gun is propped up against the side of the tiny baby's bed . Exploited: A masked young girl of around three-years-old is seen dressed in full combat gear, carrying an AK47 assault rifle, and raising her index figure to make a well-known jihadi gesture . Although the images were posted on Twitter over the past year, they form part of a new study of the everyday lives and, inevitably, deaths of the young Western women who chose to live under ISIS. One photograph in the study, which was published on Buzzfeed, shows a woman calling herself\u00a0Umm Abdullatif posting a photograph of a young boy aged about five dressed in military fatigues and firing a huge assault rifle. She identifies the child as her son's 'lil best mate' and suggests he has already been killed, adding that she hope her own child 'grows up to be like him and receives and beautiful death just like him'. Another photograph, this time posted by a woman calling herself Umm Usama, shows a one-year-old girl sleeping alongside a small, black pistol and is captioned 'Even my baby girl goes 2 bed with her gun #generationkhilafah'. A similar image was posted on Twitter showing a newborn baby fast asleep in a plastic crate and covered in a Hello Kitty blanket. The otherwise adorable photograph is ruined, however, by the fact an AK47 machine gun is propped up against the side of the tiny baby's bed. The image was posted on Twitter by a man claiming to be the child's father and was captioned: 'The Little Terrorist #Hammam was born in the land of the caliphate, I ask God Almighty to make him one of the Caliphate\u2019s soldiers.' Horror: Featuring titles such as 'The Little Terrorist' and 'Generation Kilafah', the chilling images show innocent children being forced to embrace their parents' extremism in ISIS' de facto capital Raqqa . A woman calling herself Umm Abdullatif posting a photograph of a young boydressed in military fatigues and firing a huge assault rifle. She identifies him as her son's 'lil best mate', suggests he has already been killed, and adds that she hope her own child 'grows up to be like him and receives and beautiful death just like him' The study reveals numerous other images of young children being exploited for shocking photographs that are later posted by their twisted parents on social media. The majority show young boys and girls dressed in combat clothing and brandishing weapons and are captioned with horrific messages by their parents wishing the children a hasty death. Others show young boys and girls wearing clothing daubed in the chilling black and white ISIS logo, stating that the children are being 'raised as lions' who will one day fight against the West. The overall effect is to instill fear in the West that even if the current generation of ISIS jihadis are killed, there will still be generation after generation of bloodthirsty, brainwashed terrorists ready to fight and die in order to carry out atrocities against innocent people. The use of sickening images of gun toting children also allows the often very young militant parents to brag and boast about how 'hardcore' they are, distancing themselves from Western ideals of parenthood and encouraging them to take part in a pathetic one-upmanship on social media. Sick: This photograph shows young boys whose fathers have all been killed fighting for ISIS posing in the terror group's capital city Raqqa. The woman who posted the image said that the boys' mothers  are now raising them to be the next generation of anti-Western terrorists ready to fight and die for ISIS . Two young British women posted this photograph on Twitter saying they were living in ISIS' capital city Raqqa . The study of ISIS wives was released as an Australian jihadist widow shared a series of propaganda pictures she says shows her 'five star jihad' lifestyle - and says she and other female jihadists are 'thirsty' for the blood of her former countrymen. In photographs posted to a Twitter account believed to belong to former Melbourne woman Zehra Duman, several women are pictured standing under an Islamic State flag, reclining against a clean white BMW M5, wielding machine guns and dressed from head to toe in black Islamic dress. In one tweet, Duman said: 'US + Australia, how does it feel that all 5 of us were born n raised in your lands, & now here thirsty for ur blood?' Another image of five women standing under an Islamic State flag is captioned: 'Can't mess with my clique. From the land down under, to the land of Khilafah. Thats the Aussie spirit.' Duman's account follows the similar naming conventions as previous social media accounts. It also \u00a0featured pictures of her late reported partner, the so-called 'Playboy Jihadi' Mahmoud Abdullatif, as her 'beautiful husband'. Daily Mail Australia reported in January that Duman congratulated her late partner for his death after he was reportedly killed.\u00a0'You won the race!' she tweeted, describing him as a 'green bird' - the term used to describe a so-called martyr. Life as normal: Women living under the rule of ISIS in Syria regularly post photographs of the food they are eating online and boasting that electricity in Raqqa is continuing to run . Another photograph of food posted online by ISIS militants was captioned ' Breakfast in the Islamic State' Despite the brutal treatment of men and women living under the rule of the Islamic State in Syria, thousands of Westerners have made the journey to the terrorists' de facto Syrian capital Raqqa. Yesterday it emerged that yet another young woman had fled the UK in a bid to reach ISIS. Photographed in a police cell, the 21-year-old jihadi suspect named by officials as Jaila Nadra H was arrested by Turkish security services as she waited to board a bus in Ankara. They believe the Muslim convert from East London was attempting to travel to the lawless and often porous border with Syria. The woman faces being deported back to the UK where she is likely to be arrested on suspicion of preparing acts of terrorism. Sky News reports she is being held pending deportation hearings. One official said she was expected to be deported 'soon'. Last night her family expressed shock at her arrest. \u00a0A cousin told the Daily Mail: 'She converted to Islam several years ago and we hear little from her... Her father has recently come out of hospital where he was undergoing chemotherapy. It is hard to believe this could happen.' Turkish officials said authorities apprehended the woman based on local intelligence and were not tipped off by British authorities. Five star jihad: The ISIS wives study emerged as a Twitter account understood to belong to Zehra Duman posted a series of photographs of jihadist women 'from Australia and the US' posing with a BMW M5 . Alarming: Zehra Duman posted this photograph to social media with the caption: '5 star jihad. M5 (the BMW) in the land of sham (Syria) he he ' Turkish authorities are holding a 21-year-old British woman named by officials as Jaila Nadra H (pictured) on suspicion of trying to travel to Syria and into Islamic State territory to join the terror group . The arrest comes days after three British teenagers were arrested at the airport in the Turkish city of Istanbul and thrown out of the country. The young men, two aged 17 and a third aged 19, were questioned by counter-terrorism police on their return to the UK and released on bail. They have told their families they wanted to go to Syria to 'help', and denied subscribing to the beliefs of militant Islamists. Last month three British girls \u2013 Shamima Begum, 15, Kadiza Sultana, 16, and Amira Abase, 15 \u2013 travelled to Turkey.\u00a0They were following in the footsteps of a fourth girl from their school, a close friend, who travelled to Syria last December. There are increasing concerns about the growing numbers of young people being lured to the warzone in Syria and Iraq. Last week David Cameron said everyone has a responsibility to examine why people should want to join Islamic State. Turkey is an important ally to the West as European states attempt to stem the flow of foreign fighters bolstering the ranks of Islamic State. It has been criticised for allowing fighters to cross the border into Syria but in return has asked why other countries allow militants to travel in the first place.",

        "document": "A paleo cookbook for infants co-authored by My Kitchen Rules chef Pete Evans has been delayed over grave concerns about a recipe for baby formula made from liver and bone broth. The cookbook, Bubba Yum Yum: The Paleo Way, has been slammed by the Public Health Association of Australia as having the potential to stunt the growth of babies and impair development. One recipe is a do-it-yourself baby formula made from\u00a0liver and bone broth - one of Evans' signature Paleo creations. Scroll down for video . Bubba Yum Yum: The Paleo Way, has been slammed by the Public Health Association of Australia as having the potential to stunt the growth of babies . 'In my view, there's a very real possibility that a baby may die if this book goes ahead,' said Professor Heather Yeatman, president of the PHAA. The cookbook is the joint venture of celebrity chef Evans, a long time advocate for the paleo diet, baby-blogger Charlotte Carr and naturopath Helen Padarin. Evans has previously released two best-selling cookbooks through publisher Pan MacMillan, including titles Family Food and Healthy Every Day, and Carr, the wife of Australian Idol contestant Wes Carr, runs the popular Bubba Yum Yum website. Bubba Yum Yum: the Paleo Way was marketed as 'simple, delicious paleo recipes for new mothers, babies and toddlers' by 'health crusaders' Carr,  Padarin and Evans, who 'have seen firsthand the positive impact a paleo way of eating has had on their families' wellbeing'. The greatest concern, especially given that none of the authors have medical qualifications, lie with the do-it-yourself baby formula, which is made primarily from liver and bone broth, reported The Australian Women's Weekly. Publisher Pan Macmillan has reportedly held off on the scheduled release date of the cookbook of March 13 . Evans posted a 2,100 word rant on social media in October last year claiming that the modern Australian diet is behind the rise in autism . Charlotte Carr (left), the wife of Australian Idol contestant Wes Carr (centre), runs the popular Bubba Yum Yum website and is a co-author of the book . The broth reportedly contains ten times the recommended daily intake of Vitamin A for infants, but lacks other basic nutrients needed for sustenance. Professor Yeatman said that while adults have the choice to follow the paleo diet, which excludes dairy and grains, parents are responsible for the diet of their children and that it would be unfair for parents to force 'unproven' beliefs on them. Evans, who is currently on a national tour promoting the paleo lifestyle, has long been a passionate advocate of the diet . 'That's the really troubling thing: the infant is totally at the whim of their parents when it comes to feeding. If the wrong decision is made, they may be seriously affected,' she said. Further concerns have been raised about the inclusion of runny eggs and added salt in the recipes, which contradicts national health guidelines. Federal Health Minister Sussan Ley has allegedly been contacted regarding the issue, and publisher Pan Macmillan has reportedly held off on the scheduled release date of the cookbook of March 13. The Federal Department of Health released a statement regarding the concerns that had been brought to its attention. 'The Department of Health is aware of this publication and has concerns about the inadequate nutritional value of some of the recipes, in particular the infant formula, and has been consulting with experts and will continue to investigate this matter,' the statement said. In July last year, the Dietitians Association of Australia (DAA) criticised the paleo diet, with\u00a0the association's chief executive officer Claire Hewat labelling the Paleo diet was 'potentially dangerous' and evidence of its benefits 'just doesn't stack up'. The Paleo diet requires people to cut out 'grains, legumes, certain dairy products, conventionally-raised meats, non-organic produce, and genetically modified and processed foods', which Ms Hewart says is not practical for many Australians. A disclaimer at the back of the cookbook states that the co-authors 'in good faith' the recipes will lead to a healthier life, 'relying on the information contained in this publication may not give you the results you desire or may cause negative health consequences.' Pete Evans, pictured with fellow paleo enthusiasts Luke Hines (left), and Wes Carr, wife of fellow co-author Charlotte Carr, has been an outspoken advocate of the paleo diet . Evans has previously released two best-selling cookbooks through publisher Pan MacMillan, including titles Family Food and Healthy Every Day . Despite this, the book has been described as 'a treasure trove of nutritional information and nourishing paleo recipes that are guaranteed to put you and your little one on the path to optimum health.' Evans, who is currently on a national tour promoting the paleo lifestyle, has long been a passionate advocate of the diet, and has come under fire for some of his more controversial claims about the Australian food industry. Evans posted a 2,100 word rant on social media in October last year claiming that the modern Australian diet is behind the rise in autism, taking aim at the Heart Foundation and the Dietitians Association of Australia (DAA)  as he promoted the so-called benefits of the paleo diet. His fiery rant, which was motivated by a comment from a dietician on his Facebook page, challenged the idea of the Heart Foundation's tick and also questioned some of the beliefs held by the DAA - both of which have spoken out against the paleo diet. Pan MacMillan has been contacted for comment.",

        "document": "The callous owner of this tiny Rottweiler puppy threw her out with the rubbish after severe spinal damage left her unable to stand. Vets made the difficult decision to put the stricken three-month-old animal to sleep due to the serious nature of her injuries. The puppy was found curled up in a cardboard box and dumped next to some bins in Enfield, north London. Vets were forced to put down this dumped three-month-old Rottweiler puppy after it was unable to stand due to severe spinal damage . A second newborn Rottweiler cross, believed to be from the same litter, was found nearby and showed signs of mistreatment. Anna White, manager at the RSPCA's Southridge Animal Centre, in Potters Bar, Hertfordshire, described it as one of the saddest cases she has seen. 'This poor puppy was brought to us in the cardboard box she was found in, and could not stand up, let alone walk, and definitely could not get out of the box,' she said. 'Her back legs were just not working properly and she was very, very poorly. And yet she was just left like this, on her own, on a busy London street in the freezing cold. 'She was tossed out, when she was at her most vulnerable. It is just heartbreaking.' X-rays revealed the dog had extensive spinal damage but vets were unable to ascertain whether it was due to the abuse or a birth defect. RSPCA inspector Kate Ford said: 'We do not know how this poor dog came to be dumped in this way and can't be sure whether her health issues were something she was born with or were the result of some mistreatment. 'She was of a very distinct silver-hued colouring, and there have also been reports of other puppies in the area of North London with similar colouring, also being mistreated, so the concern is that there could be others out there in need of help. The eight puppies could have died after being dumped in a rubbish bin in Queenferry, North Wales . Eight tiny newborn puppies found in a rubbish bin were at the centre of an RSPCA investigation. The tiny pups - some with their umbilical cords still attached - were discovered by a group of a children in Queensferry, North Wales. Bosses from the animal charity said they were stunned at how someone could throw away the animals as if they were rubbish. As well as praising the quick-thinking actions of the youngsters who contacted a local dog warden after yesterday's shocking discovery in Chester Road East, officials also urged anyone with information to come forward. RSPCA inspector Tim Jones said: 'It is totally unnecessary and these puppies could have died if nobody had heard them. They could not be seen in the bin. 'They all appeared to be fine but are very young as some of them had their umbilical cords still attached.' 'We are appealing for information to try and find out who abandoned these tiny dogs.' The puppies - thought to be Staffordshire bull terrier cross-breeds - are now being cared for the RSPCA. Anyone with information on the puppies should contact the RSPCA on 0300 123 8018.",

        "document": "A family are furious after staff refused to allow their soya and dairy intolerant toddler to eat his special packed lunch in the restaurant. Alex and Coral Pouros had spent \u00a330 on the day out to Wingham Wildlife Park with 20 month-old Elliot. They had prepared a special meal for the youngster who is restricted on what he can eat because of an intolerance to dairy and soya, and planned to buy food for themselves from the zoo restaurant. Alex and Coral Pouros (pictured with their son) had spent \u00a330 on the day out to Wingham Wildlife Park with 20 month-old Elliot . But they were furious when park owner Tony Binskin insisted they could not eat in the restaurant and offered them a nearby empty room instead. The family refused and left the zoo near Canterbury, Kent after just two hours and vowed never to return. Osteopath Alex, 32, said: 'We explained the situation and as it was very cold outside I thought he would be understanding. 'I even said that if they had any dairy or soya-free food, we would buy that for Elliott. 'They didn't, but he still insisted he could not eat his lunch in the restaurant. The couple had prepared a special meal for the youngster who is restricted on what he can eat because of an intolerance to lactose and soya . The couple had planned to buy their own lunch at Wingham Wildlife Park's restaurant (pictured) 'To be honest, we were pretty upset because it seemed totally unreasonable. It's not as if the place was packed because there were plenty of places to sit. 'I wasn't prepared for Elliott to have to eat his lunch outside in the cold and told the owner that we had two choices - either we were allowed to sit indoors or we would have to leave. 'But he wouldn't budge so we left after spending \u00a330 to get in and having a visit that lasted just a couple of hours.' Alex, of Broadstairs, Kent, added: 'It was actually Coral's 32nd birthday and we thought it would be a nice day out, but sadly it wasn't. 'We had been to the park before with a young niece and enjoyed the experience but this time we just felt angry and hurt and certainly won't be going back.' Markus Wilder, curator of the animal collection, disputed the family's claim there was no options for their son at the cafe. 'We have a menu of 55 items and there are only ten of them that contain soya or dairy,' he said. 'Any of our cooked meals he would have been fine to eat; we have jacket potatoes, burgers...' But the family were furious when park owner Tony Binskin insisted they could not eat in the restaurant and offered them a nearby empty room instead . The family left the zoo near Canterbury, Kent after just two hours and have since vowed never to return . Mr Wilder said the family had been asked to leave the restaurant due to the park's strict policy but claimed they had been offered their own private room instead. 'We're only a fairly small park, and we have fairly limited seating so we have a policy that you cannot eat outside food from outside in the restaurant. It applies across the board. 'The trouble is if we let one person have a packed lunch, then others see it and start to ask why they have been refused. 'It just gets very awkward for us because many people and children have special dietary requirements these days. 'In this case, I spoke to the family and did offer them an empty room nearby where they could still eat indoors, but the mother, in particular, still wasn't happy. 'We also have covered areas outside for people who bring their own food. 'We are looking at expanding the food range to accommodate more needs but our animals must come first and we can't direct funding away from them.'",

        "document": "Death Row: Kelly Gissendaner (pictured) is set to die by lethal injection in Georgia at 7pm tonight . The only woman in Georgia on death row is due to be executed tonight at 7pm - after an astonishing last meal of cheeseburgers, fries, ice cream and a fatty salad - unless lawyers can convince officials to spare her life. Kelly Renee Gissendaner, 46, is due to be given a lethal injection at a state prison in Jackson in retribution for plotting the murder of her husband in 1997. She was sentenced to die after her boyfriend, Gregory Owen, stabbed Douglas Gissendaner to death at her urging. Gissendaner, who will be the first female executed in Georgia in 70 years, has also made headlines with her request from prison authorities for a no-holds-barred last meal. The feast includes two Burger King Whoppers, two large orders of fries, cornbread, a salad drenched in buttermilk dressing, popcorn and cherry-vanilla ice cream. However, there is a chance she receive a last-minute stay of execution - if her lawyers convince Georgia's justice system to cancel the killing. Attorneys are mounting a last-ditch attempt to persuade the State Board of Pardons and Paroles to commute her sentence to life without parole. She was denied clemency at a hearing last week, but lawyers argue that extra witnesses from within the prison system could help persuade them. Previous attempts have rested on her remorse and new-found faith. In a statement ten years ago,\u00a0Gissendaner herself said: 'I deserve to be here, but I don't deserve to die'. Murder: Gissendaner, shown left in her arrest mugshot from 1997, is facing death for plotting the murder of her husband. However, her boyfriend Gregory Owen, right, who actually did the deed, is not on death row and could be paroled within a decade . Monster meal: Gissendaner, pictured above with a regular prison meal, requested an enormous spread including two cheeseburger meals, cornbread, ice cream, and popcorn for her last meal . She has also drawn attention to the fact that, while she did not kill her husband, the man who struck the fatal blows is not facing death - and will be eligible for parole in 2023. If the bid fails, her lawyers are expected to ask the Supreme Court to intervene. It has already denied one appeal. Her execution had been due to take place last week, but was canceled after a winter storm caused disruption in the area. Gissendaner would be the first woman executed in Georgia since 1945 and only the 16th woman put to death nationwide since the Supreme Court allowed the death penalty to resume in 1976. Gissendaner's lawyers note that the parole board already heard from many people testifying about her faith and remorse at a hearing last week before denying her clemency. But, her lawyers argue, the board did not hear from many Department of Corrections employees whose perspective 'would have left no doubt that a grant of clemency is supported in this case.' The most important witness the board did not hear from is Kathy Seabolt, who served as her warden for six years, first at Metro State Prison and then at Lee Arrendale State Prison. Locked away: Gissendaner, pictured above in 2004, has been locked up for the past 17 years . Seabolt could testify that former parole board chair James Donald promised Gissendaner would receive clemency, her lawyers wrote. Each time the topic came up in conversations between Donald and Seabolt, 'Donald reiterated his statement that Ms. Gissendaner did not need to worry about clemency as it was a foregone conclusion,' they wrote. Gissendaner's lawyers also urged the parole board to subpoena some other corrections employees so they can testify without fear of retaliation. Although department rules allow employees to speak to lawyers for capital clemency proceedings, the reality is less clear, Gissendaner's lawyers wrote. Some employees had said they would testify and provide written statements on Gissendaner's behalf, but changed their minds after getting a memo from the new warden, who succeeded Seabolt last year. 'Under no circumstances are you to discuss this with people outside the institution. Staff should also be careful what is said to other inmates and personal feelings are to be suppressed,' Kathleen Kennedy wrote on Jan. 29 as she notified staff of the likelihood of the upcoming execution. Gissendaner's lawyers also urged the board to consider that before trial, she had been offered the same plea deal as Owen - life in prison with an agreement not to seek parole for 25 years. 'At one time, therefore, all the parties involved in the case thought a sentence less than death was appropriate for Ms. Gissendaner,' her lawyers wrote. Owen, who is the one who stabbed Douglas Gissendaner to death, took the deal and testified for the prosecution. Gissendaner balked at the parole agreement and took her lawyer's advice to go to trial. The parole board has granted clemency before in cases involving disproportionate sentences for co-defendants, her lawyers wrote. 'In fact, this Board has on at least four occasions in the past commuted a death sentence of a co-defendant who was not the actual killer of the victim,' the lawyers wrote. Douglas Gissendaner's parents and sisters want her to be executed, but two of Kelly and Douglas' three children have asked the parole board to spare her life, the lawyers wrote. In statements submitted with her clemency application, Kayla and Dakota Gissendaner describe a journey from bitterness and anger to forgiveness; finally they have a meaningful relationship with their mother. 'We also believe that Kelly's death will not restore them or make them whole,' Gissendaner's lawyers wrote of the entire Gissendaner family.",

A teenager who grinned for his mugshot after staggering drunk out of a family wedding to carry out a 'terrifying' crime spree involving burglary and sexual assault has been jailed for five and a half years. Connor King, 18, went on a rampage after the reception, breaking into a flat in\u00a0Folkestone, Kent, where two women and a baby were sleeping. He woke the women and demanded alcohol but when they refused he threatened to kill them and they had to lock themselves in a bedroom. King then went into a second bedroom and attacked a man while he was sleeping, punching him in the head up to 30 times before sexually assaulting him. Canterbury Crown Court heard he then demanded money, picked up a screwdriver and threatened to stab him. When his victim refused he hurled a TV at him. He then assaulted another neighbour who had heard the women's screams and stole a gold sovereign ring, a wallet, a mobile phone and USB cable. King then went next door where he woke a couple and their young child as he climbed out a window to escape, telling them: 'I am going to a party'. Police arrived to find the teenager standing on a window ledge 25ft from the ground before he climbed down and shouted: 'I'm a terrorist'. King admitted six charges of assault, burglary and sexual assault and was sent to a Young Offenders' Institute for five-and-a-half years. Judge Heather Norton told him: 'You embarked on a course of conduct that night which must have been terrifying for everybody involved.' Not smiling anymore:\u00a0King admitted six charges of assault, burglary and sexual assault at Canterbury Crown Court\u00a0and was sent to a Young Offenders' Institute for five-and-a-half years . Phil Rowley, defending, said King was drunk and had no recollection of the night. He said King had been used to help carry out burglaries since he was five. Detective Constable Neil Moore said: 'It was clear he was heavily intoxicated and decided, in what was a truly bizarre set of circumstances, to hunt out more alcohol. 'It must have been truly terrifying for those involved and the sentence imposed reflects the severity of the crime.'",

        "document": "They are known as some of nature's most reclusive predators, and it seems this owl was keen to live up to that reputation when it was spotted by a photographer in a park in the Czech Republic. Peeking out from behind a tree, the huge bird of prey appeared to play hide and seek with senior engineer and photographer Jiri Michal as he tried to capture it on film. The amusing game of peek-a-boo took place in Vysoka, a small village in the country's hilly east, while the seven-year-old male owl was out hunting. Surprise: A great grey owl pokes it head out from behind a tree as\u00a0Jiri Michal, 34, a senior engineer and photographer, captures the bird of prey on film . Playing games: Mr Michal, who spent three hours trying to photograph owls before spotting this one, said he wasn't sure what the bird was doing, but it appeared to be playing a game with him . Mr Michal, 34, of Pilsen, Czech Republic, said: 'I wasn't sure what this mischievous owl was doing, however it kept poking its head out from behind this tree as if it was playing a game with me. 'Owls are definitely my favourite birds. They have amazing eyes and are always pleasure to photograph.' Mr Michal said he had been photographing the birds for three hours when he spotted this one roughly 20ft away. He added: 'This owl was not in the mood to play for too long, and straight after I took these pictures he flew off. 'I'm forever thinking up new ideas for what to photograph and I love nature as a whole. From the smallest insects to the larger birds and mammals, they must all be protected.' The great grey owl is the largest species of owl, measuring up to two and a half feet in length, and lives in northern America, Canada, and northern Europe. Despite owl's reputation as night hunters, great grey owls often seek out prey during the day, perching high in branches and using their excellent hearing and eyesight to track down prey. Now you see me: The great grey owl is the largest species of owl, measuring up to two and a half feet in length. Despite the animal's reputation for being nocturnal, this species often hunts during the day . Youngster: Mr Michal believes the owl was a male, and was around seven years old, making it relatively young. Captive birds have been known to live up to 27 years old . Their large face, and two disc-shaped plumes of feathers around their eyes, act as satellite dishes, filtering sound into two highly sensitive ears under the feathers. Their hearing is so acute that, during the winter months, the owls often hunt by swooping low over snow drifts, listening for the sound of voles or gophers moving around underneath. Their large, soft feathers and slow, deep wingbeats mean they are nearly silent as they move, so as not to scare their prey away. Once they have locked on to a target underneath the snow, they will use their sharp talons to plunge through the ice and drag their meal out. While the birds are not migratory, they will roam for miles around their usual hunting grounds if prey becomes scarce.",

        "document": "Johnny Herbert believes McLaren could find themselves at the back end of the grid when the new Formula One season gets under way. The Woking-based marque have struggled to put in the pre-season testing miles due to a number of issues with their new car - with Honda returning to the sport and providing their first attempt at a current F1 power unit. With other teams pounding around Jerez and Barcelona collecting valuable data and information ahead of the season opener in Melbourne on March 15, McLaren have often found their car back in the garage with one fault or another. The McLaren car could struggle at the start of the season, reckons Johnny Herbert . Herbert fears for McLaren . Add to that the fact two-time world champion Fernando Alonso will not be racing in Australia after crashing out at high-speed in Barcelona and it has not been the best reunion for McLaren and Honda - with Herbert tipping them to really struggle in the opening rounds. 'There is definitely a chance of that,' Herbert said when asked if the eight-time constructors' champions could find themselves behind a host of other teams this year. 'So many cars have improved. The middle of the pack seems very close. Lotus seem better, Sauber look better. Ferrari look faster than they were last year as well - Red Bull and Toro Rosso, also. 'The middle pack is tight but we haven't seen the McLaren setting their best times so we don't know where they will be. 'The run of over 100 laps (from Button in Barcelona) put them in the middle of that pack - is that a true showing of their pace? We really don't know. 'We don't know the whole grid order because I don't think everyone has shown their full hand and, unfortunately for McLaren and everyone else, I don't think Mercedes have either.' With the news that Alonso, re-signed to the team after the Spaniard left Ferrari, will be sitting out of the curtain-raiser after his mysterious crash has only added to McLaren's issues - with Herbert questioning why the rekindled relationship with Honda has got off to such an underwhelming start. 'McLaren have been a disappointment so far,' the former Benetton and Stewart driver told the Press Association. Fernando Alonso will miss the curtain-raiser in Australia after his horrific crash in Barcelona . 'You were thinking \"Honda have come back and are back with McLaren again. They had all the success in the late 80s and they had last year to look and see what was going on - they saw other manufacturers having to overcome issues whilst they were working on their engine. 'All of these issues they have had have made it really difficult for them to get any serious running whatsoever. They have had a mass of problems that haven't helped them. 'It is sad news that Fernando will not be in Australia - everything has gone against them so far. 'The preparation is something that maybe wasn't to the high standards than Ron Dennis is always after. 'This is something that should have been ready, the new Honda relationship and moving it forward with Jenson and Fernando. 'If it all comes together they might get a good result but it is going to be hard in the opening couple of races - the hardest of their careers.'",

        "document": "(CNN)As expected, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave a rousing speech to Congress, rich in historic imagery and replete with literary references. Yet a speech filled with powerful words is no substitute for a strategy for actually preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. As national security adviser Susan Rice told the pro-Israel lobbying group AIPAC on Monday, \"Precisely because this is such a serious issue, we must weigh the different options before us and choose the best one. Sound bites won't stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.\" The Obama administration, on the other hand, is making a strong and credible case that the deal it is pursuing would block Iran's pathways to developing the fissile material necessary for a bomb and extend the time for Iran to produce enough weapons-grade uranium to build a bomb from today's estimated three months to at least a year. Without a deal, Iran would revert to building up its stockpile of nuclear uranium, while the international community would lose the ability to monitor and track Iran's activities. At the top of the list of questions the Prime Minister failed to address is how such a scenario in the wake of \"no deal\" would actually make Israel safer? As Rice said: \"Here's what's likely to happen without a deal. Iran will install and operate advanced centrifuges. Iran will seek to fuel its (plutonium) reactor in Arak. Iran will rebuild its uranium stockpile.  And, we'll lose the unprecedented inspections and transparency we have today.\" If no deal that the United States and five other powers actually might strike with the Iranians would be acceptable to Netanyahu, how does he propose to deal with the Iranian nuclear threat? He spoke about ratcheting up international sanctions against Iran and keeping them in place until Iran ceased regional aggression, sponsorship of terrorism and threatens to annihilate Israel. But years of extraordinarily tough sanctions did not persuade the Iranians to abandon their nuclear program or prevent them moving it forward. Neither did cyberwarfare or a series of assassinations of Iranian scientists. And if the United States was seen as walking away from a possible agreement, the international sanctions regime would likely crumble, not strengthen. Iranian hard-liners who oppose an agreement would be back in the driver's seat in Tehran, while those would want to see Iran rejoin the international community would be discredited and sidelined. It is doubtful that Netanyahu really believes sanctions would end the Iranian nuclear program. That leaves one other option -- military force. Of course, Israel could order a military strike on Iran any time it chooses, but Israel's ability to inflict significant damage on Iran's widely dispersed and heavily defended nuclear facilities is limited. When the discussion turns to military action, what is really meant is U.S. military action. It is understandable that a foreign leader speaking in the U.S. Congress would shy away from openly asking Washington to attack another country, especially after the experience of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, which Netanyahu also lobbied for. We should recall Netanyahu's September 2002 testimony to the House Foreign Affairs Committee, six months before the U.S. assault on Baghdad began, when he said: \"It's not a question of whether Iraq's regime should be taken out but when should it be taken out; it's not a question of whether you'd like to see a regime change in Iran but how to achieve it.\" Netanyahu may have learned from that experience. He knows that the U.S. public is weary of war and has no appetite for another military adventure in the Middle East. That's why he advocates policies that would put the United States on a path to military action without mentioning the words \"military action.\" This Israeli leader, who faces a tough election back home in two weeks, has mastered the art of policy vagueness. He applied the same strategy to the failed negotiations with the Palestinians last year, declaring he was in favor of a two-state solution but never putting forward a detailed proposal for where the border should be drawn -- or on any other substantive issue for that matter. His biggest demand once again was rhetorical -- that the Palestinians recognize Israel as a Jewish state. This is an Israeli leader who believes in the power of words -- especially his words. But words are no substitute for a strategy -- and that's where Netanyahu once again failed himself, his country and his audience.",

        "document": "The League Cup remains Celtic\u2019s Achilles heel. The Scottish trophy which has eluded them most often. Since beating Saturday's opponents Dundee United in the 1997-98 final, the Parkhead club have won it a further four times. To supporters of smaller, provincial clubs, that would be a form of nirvana. A glorious period of outstanding achievement. Ronny Deila is determined to get his hands on the League Cup after Sunday's final against Dundee United . To Celtic, it\u2019s a source of mild failure. In the same period the club has captured twice as many league titles. And six Scottish Cups The clubs previous two managers, Tony Mowbray and Neil Lennon, didn\u2019t win the League Cup at all and Lennon\u2019s record in cups was a source of occasional unrest. For Ronny Deila, then, the first trophy of his Celtic tenure would be hugely significant. \u2018It is something we would remember for the rest of our lives,\u2019 said the Norwegian. \u2018Cup finals are big. They are big in Norway and in Scotland and England. This tradition is important.\u2019 Bold and forthright, Deila has publicly pledged to win a Treble. Managers usually play down talk of clean sweeps and banish the very words from their vocabulary. A fatalistic, superstitious streak runs through Scottish football, but Deila isn\u2019t having it. Far from piling pressure on himself or his players, he believes it sets a target to strive for. Celtic expect to win all three domestic trophies every season. Saying so should be no cause for palpitations. \u2018I am very calm,\u2019 said Deila with a grin. \u2018Maybe too much. Hopefully it will come on Sunday - but we have so many big matches you get used to it. \u2018If this had been a small club, the cup final would be totally crazy. It would be all: \u201cWho is going to sit here and what are we going to do with the supporters?\u201d But this club has done it so many times, so it\u2019s very calm. \u2018We just prepare for what\u2019s ahead of us and I think we can feel in the atmosphere of the players there is a big game coming up. Again, we can reach one of our targets and that\u2019s important.\u2019 Deila issues instructions to his players during the recent Scottish Cup quarter-final draw with Dundee United . In one sense he is correct. Celtic have been in many cup finals, too many to mention. But he hasn\u2019t. \u2018In 2010, Stromsgodset beat a First Division team in the final,\u2019 he recalled. \u2018I played in 2001 and won, then lost one in 2002. The cup final is big in Norway, there is only one cup and, like the FA Cup, it\u2019s the last game of the season and is always sold out. \u2018I have seen crazy things at the cup final. Things like: \u201cWho is going to sit beside the King?\u201d That\u2019s how it is with small clubs. Not here.\u2019 He believes Celtic are favourites to win because they have the bigger squad. More options. Those options will be diminished if Nir Bitton, an increasingly influential midfielder, fails to overcome a swollen ankle. But Kris Commons is fit again and ready. \u2018Kris trained yesterday (Thursday) and looked good,\u2019 reported Deila. \u2018Adam Matthews is a bit too early. Bitton will hopefully reach it, though he has still not trained. But he is very determined, so hopefully he will reach it. \u2018We will give him until Sunday because he is a very important player. We want him to play and I think he has a good chance.\u2019 That Celtic have the personnel is beyond doubt. There will be more focus at Hampden on the discipline of the teams. Dundee United manager\u00a0Jackie McNamara poses with the Celtic boss and the League Cup at Hampden . So edgy and ill-tempered \u2013 and hugely enjoyable - was the Scottish Cup tie between these two teams at Tannadice last Sunday that people are already looking for \u2018afters.\u2019 Evidence of bad blood which might lead to another day of big decisions and navel-gazing over the state of Scottish refereeing. Warning his team to keep their discipline, Deila recalled: \u2018It was the same against Rangers. If you lose your discipline there and get a red card you can lose the game. \u2018I think we have been disciplined. Last Sunday some things happened after a situation. \u2018Again, when something happens like that you must keep discipline and focus. So I expect my players to do that in every game now. \u2018We have to be disciplined. We have to think and we have to not do stupid things. Stay on your feet and nothing will happen. \u2018You have to have controlled aggression. John Collins is always saying that. We have to be determined and high on motivation and aggression. \u2018We have to be clear thinkers about what to do in certain situations. We want the team to be like that and we want to be the same way.\u2019 Chief Executive Peter Lawwell and Deila pictured after Celtic announce new agreement with New Balance . He locked his players away in a form of exile at their Lennoxtown training ground before the Rangers game and has employed similar tactics this week. Nothing has been left to chance. The Scottish League Cup gets a bad press. The crowds are poor, the interest levels low. The semi-finals were played on a Hampden pitch better suited to Chinese rice farmers, but a new surface has been laid for the final and Deila gave it the all-clear after a brief walkabout on Thursday. The prospect of a new Celtic manager going for his first trophy in charge sets a new narrative for Sunday. Nothing will be left to chance in pursuit of the prize. \u2018All I do is go to Lennoxtown and then go home,\u2019 said Deila. \u2018You have to prepare for whatever is coming up, the next game all the time, and it has been a usual week for us. \u2018We have big goals and one of them is to win trophies. The other is to develop the club in the direction I want it to go and they want it to go. \u2018We have started well. The first year is always so hard wherever you go. You have to get people to understand what you believe in and you have to get to know people. If we can start by winning a trophy on Sunday, it would be a very good start.\u2019",

Kane's two goals fired Spurs to a 2-1 win over Rangers on Saturday and took his personal tally to 26 goals in all competitions this season. Austin and Kane are both jostling for a spot in Roy Hodgson's England squad, which is announced later this month, but the QPR striker had only praise for his compatriot. QPR striker Charlie Austin has praised the 'exceptional form' of Spurs counterpart Harry Kane this season . Harry Kane, who scored twice for Tottenham at QPR on Saturday, has impressed Charlie Austin this season . Kane fires home Tottenham' second goal in the Premier League encounter at Loftus Road . 'Harry Kane has been in exceptional form this season,' Austin told paddypower.com. 'He was the difference between us and Tottenham on Saturday - and he is a great example of this self-belief. 'That brace makes it eight goals in six league games and when you're on that run you just want the games to keep coming. 'He's confident going into games, and he's confident when he's front of goal that he's going to score. 'That's the kind of confidence that a striker really wants and it will inevitably benefit the team.' Austin has enjoyed an excellent campaign himself, scoring 15 goals in his debut season in the top flight. Charlie Austin is also in England contention after scoring 15 Premier League goals this season . Charlie Austin's shot flies past Spurs goalkeeper Hugo Lloris for a consolation goal on Saturday . A dip in form saw Austin score just once in seven matches at the start of the year but two goals in his last three games suggests the 25-year-old his rediscovering his rhythm. 'If you're a confident striker the ball will always fall to you in the right positions,' Austin said. 'If you're in form there's nothing stopping you picking the ball up 25 yards out and having a shot, whereas a striker low on confidence might play it out wide and be slightly more conservative. 'If you get the goal to kick-start the run, your self-belief keeps growing and you know you'll keep getting chances to score.' Austin is only five away from reaching the 20-goal mark in the league this season but the striker insists he has not set any targets. England manager Roy Hodgson monitored both Kane and Austin at Loftus Road on Saturday . 'I've never got into the habit of setting myself personal targets,' Austin added. 'If you set yourself a target you can give yourself something to achieve, but if you don't hit those aims you see yourself as a failure. 'For me that isn't a motivation. It was my first season in the Premier League this year and I wanted to go in all guns blazing and just see what I could do.'",

        "document": "Dozens of aging U.S. veterans, many in their early 90s and some in wheelchairs, gathered on the tiny, barren island of Iwo Jima on Saturday to mark the 70th anniversary of one of the bloodiest and most iconic battles of World War II. More than 30 veterans flown in from the U.S. island territory of Guam toured the black sand beaches where they invaded the deeply dug-in forces of the island's Japanese defenders in early 1945. They were bused to the top of Mount Suribachi, an active volcano, where an Associated Press photo of the raising of the American flag while the battle was still raging became a potent symbol of hope and valor to a war-weary public back home that was growing increasingly disillusioned with the seemingly unending battle in the Pacific. Scroll down for video . In memoriam: U.S. veterans offer a wreath during a ceremony commemorating the 70th anniversary of the Battle of Iwo Jima on Iwo Jima - now known officially as Ioto - in Japan on Saturday on March 21, 2015 .

Iconic:  In this February 23, 1945 file photo, U.S. Marines raise a U.S. flag atop Mount Suribachi, Iwo Jima. The Pacific island became the site of one of the bloodiest, most famous battles of World War II against Japan . Attack: The Fifth Division Marine invaders make their way up the beach of Iwo Jima in 1945 . For some of the veterans, the return to the island where many of their comrades died, and which is still inhabited only by a contingent of Japanese military troops, brought out difficult emotions. 'I hated them,' said former Sgt. John Roy Coltrane, 93, of Siler City, North Carolina. 'For 40 years, I wouldn't even buy anything made in Japan. But now I drive a Honda.' Speeches at the Reunion of Honor ceremony held near the invasion beach were made by senior Japanese politicians and descendants of the few Japanese who survived the battle. Family members of the soldiers who died in the Battle of Iwo Jima offer water on the cenotaph on Iwo Jima . Family members of the soldiers who died in the Battle of Iwo Jima walk around a battery on Iwo Jima . Also speaking were U.S. Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus and Gen. Joseph Dunford, the commandant of the Marine Corps, who noted that the battle for Iwo Jima remains the 'very ethos' of the Marine Corps today. 'We should never forget that the peace and prosperity of Japan and the United States at present has been built on the sacrifice of precious lives,' Japanese Defense Minister Gen Nakatani said in his remarks. This was the first time that Japanese Cabinet officials attended the anniversary ceremony, now in its 16th year. And while the presence of veterans able to make the grueling trip has been steadily dwindling, the number of participants \u2014 about 500 \u2014 was double that of last year because of the significance of the 70th year since Japan's surrender ended World War II. After the joint memorial, the U.S. and Japanese dignitaries and guests went their separate ways to visit the parts of the island that were of the most significance to their own troops. The Japanese have erected several memorials to their dead, and in a traditional way of placating their souls poured water and placed flowers on the memorial sites.

Veterans and relatives of the dead returned to the Japanese island of Iwo Jima Saturday, 70 years after one of the bloodiest battles of World War II, to commemorate the 29,000 lives claimed in the fighting . Brutal:The Battle of Iwojima lasted about a month after U.S. forces landed in February 1945. About 22,000 Japanese soldiers and 7,000 U.S. servicemen died in the battle. This photo was taken February 20 . The Marines invaded Iwo Jima in February 1945, and it was only declared secured after more than a month of fighting. About 70,000 U.S. troops fought more than 20,000 Japanese \u2014 only 216 Japanese were captured as POWs and the rest are believed to have been either killed in action or to have taken their own lives. The island was declared secure on March 16, 1945, but skirmishes continued. In about 36 days of battle, nearly 7,000 U.S. Marines were killed and 20,000 wounded.

It is to this day considered sacred ground to many Japanese. As a haunting reminder of the ferocity of the fighting, search teams continue to dig up more and more Japanese remains each year \u2014 it's estimated that 12,000 have yet to be found. The United States returned the island to Japan in 1968. Wreckage of military equipment can still be seen dotting some of the beach areas, along with pill boxes and extensive mazes of caves. Though the idea of developing the island for tourism has been mulled for decades, and possibly using its natural hot springs as an attraction, the island is virtually untouched other than the small airfield used by the Japanese. Though a tiny volcanic crag, the island \u2014 now called Ioto or Iwoto on Japanese maps \u2014 was deemed strategically important because it was being used by the Japanese to launch air attacks on American bombers. Iwo Jima, now known officially as Ioto, is seen from an airplane in Japan, Saturday, March 21, 2015.  The U.S. and Japan held the ceremony Saturday to mark the 70th anniversary of one of World War II's bloodiest battles . After its capture, it was used by the U.S. as an emergency landing site for B-29s, which eventually made 2,900 emergency landings there that are estimated to have saved the lives of 24,000 airmen who would have otherwise had to crash at sea. Twenty-seven Medals of Honor were awarded for action in the battle, more than any other in U.S. military history. The only surviving Medal of Honor recipient from Iwo Jima, Hershel 'Woody' Williams, 91, attended the ceremony. Afterward, he said his feelings toward the Japanese had not changed in the decades since the battle. 'They were just doing their jobs, just like we were,' he said. 'We tried to kill them before they could kill us. But that's war.'",

        "document": "It may not look as appetising as a crisp Chardonnay or a rich bottle of Malbec, but grey wine recovered from a shipwreck is definitely more unusual. The bottle of grey liquid was recovered from a US Civil War shipwreck. Now, a panel of experts have sipped the wine and say it had a heady sulphur bouquet with distinct notes of crab water and gasoline. Grey wine recorded from\u00a0the wreck of a Civil War blockade runner that sank in 1864 waqs sampled by sommeliers, who said it tasted\u00a0like a mixture of crab water, gasoline, salt water and vinegar, with hints of citrus and alcohol . The bottle was pulled from the wreck of a Civil War blockade runner that sank off the coast of Bermuda in 1864. It was uncorked at a food festival in Charleston, South Carolina, in front of an audience of 50 who watched a panel of experts decant and taste the rare liquid. Master sommelier Paul Roberts said: \u2018I've had shipwreck wines before. They can be great.\u2019 But sadly the grey wine was not. The wine was one of five sealed bottles recovered by marine archaeologists (pictured) from the Mary-Celestia, an iron-hulled sidewheel steamship that sank under mysterious circumstances during the US Civil War . To peals of audience laughter, the panel said the cloudy yellow-grey liquid smelled and tasted like a mixture of crab water, gasoline, salt water and vinegar, with hints of citrus and alcohol. Sommeliers were not impressed with the taste of the grey ship wreck wine. Larry Stone of Napa, California is shown looking at the murky liquid . It could have been a Spanish fortified wine, a spirit, or medicine, but after 151 years at the bottom of the ocean, it's now mostly saltwater, they said. Wine chemist Pierre Louis Teissedre of the University of Bordeaux, had previously analysed samples drawn through the cork. He said the \u2018nose\u2019 of the wine was a room-clearing mix of camphor \u2013 which is used in vapour rubs to treat colds - stagnant water, hydrocarbons, turpentine and sulphur. Analysis showed it was 37 percent alcohol, he said. The wine was one of five sealed bottles recovered by marine archaeologists from the Mary-Celestia, an iron-hulled sidewheel steamship that sank under mysterious circumstances during the US Civil War. The boat was leaving Bermuda with supplies for the Confederate states when it struck a reef and sank in six minutes, said Philippe Rouja, a cultural anthropologist and custodian of historic shipwrecks for the Bermudan government. Whether the sinking was deliberate or accidental has been debated for decades. Mr Rouja and his brother, Jean-Pierre Rouja, were diving near the shipwreck in 2011 after winter storms swept over the site when they found a bottle of wine inside a secret boatswain's locker in the bow. Subsequent dives turned up the additional bottles, as well as sealed bottles of perfume, women's shoes, hairbrushes and pearl shell buttons, Philippe Rouja said. This year marks the 150th anniversary of the end of the Civil War, which was fought from 1861 to 1865 and began in Charleston Harbor with the Battle of Fort Sumter. Mr Rouja and his brother, Jean-Pierre Rouja, were diving near the shipwreck in 2011 after winter storms swept over the site when they found a bottle of wine inside a secret boatswain's locker in the bow. This image shows the excavation in process . The Mary-Celestia is a Civil War blockade runner that sank off the coast of Bermuda in 1864. The iron-hulled sidewheel steamship sank under mysterious circumstances. Leaving Bermuda with supplies for the Confederate states, the boat struck a reef and sank in six minutes. During the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln imposed a naval blockade of the US coast from Virginia to Texas in a bid to stop exports of southern cotton, turpentine and tobacco to Europe - crippling it financially. Subsequent dives turned up the additional bottles, as well as sealed bottles of perfume, women's shoes, hairbrushes and pearl shell buttons. The bottle containing the grey 'wine' is shown . The southern response to the blockade was the blockade runner - fast steamships that were manned by daredevil crews who could come under fire and faced possible imprisonment. The boats were highly profitable and saw the goods they carried selling for 200 to 700 per cent more than they had in peacetime, Archaeology.org reported. Mary-Celestia was one of them and was commissioned by two brothers in Virginia to serve their business interests in Great Britain and its colonies, including Bermuda. In its short lifetime, the ship is believed to have been chased by a US Navy blockader but escaped, leading the crew to throw 100 bales of cotton, worth $100,000 overboard to lighten the load. On its final voyage the ship was loaded with canned meat and guns. A crew member spotted rocks as the vessel approached the southern shore of Bermuda, but the pilot didn\u2019t heed the warning and the ship struck the reef. With the crew scrambling for lifeboats, the ship sank rapidly. Sinking after just two years of service rumours were rife that the pilot had deliberately wrecked the ship, but there is no evidence to suggest that he was working for the US Consul in Bermuda. Much of the cargo was retrieved, but items like wine bottles, shoes, perfume bottles and other personal effects were left behind and were revealed after Hurricane Bill in 2009.",

Bernard Jordan became known as the Great Escaper after he absconded from his carers, caught a ferry to Caen and turned up in Normandy with his service awards pinned to his blazer. His medals raised \u00a31,650 for the RNLI at Wallis and Wallis in Lewes, East Sussex. The estimate had been \u00a3300. Great Escaper:\u00a0Bernard Jordan absconded from his carers, caught a ferry to Caen and turned up in Normandy with his service awards pinned to his blazer . Mr Jordan died aged 90 on December 30, and a week later his widow Irene passed away. The couple had no immediate family and left \u00a3600,000 to the RNLI in their will. Mr Jordan was a 19-year-old Royal Navy lieutenant when on June 6, 1944, he was on a tank-landing craft in the first wave of boats to hit the Normandy beaches. He had already taken part in the Battle of the Atlantic - the cat-and-mouse conflict between Allied ships and German U-boats over the vital supply routes from Europe to the United States. At one stage he was part of the boarding party that captured one of the Enigma coding machines, used by the Nazis to scramble messages, from an enemy submarine. Following the war, Mr Jordan got into local politics and served as a town councillor for 23 years in his hometown of Hove, East Sussex. He was a a city councillor for two years and was mayor of the town from 1995 to 1996. Mr Jordan hit headlines in June last year when he went missing from his care home the day before the 75th anniversary D-Day celebrations. Without telling anyone, including his wife Irene, the plucky pensioner caught a ferry to Caen in Normandy and made his own way to the service. D-Day: Mr Jordan was a 19-year-old Royal Navy lieutenant when on June 6, 1944, he was on a tank-landing craft in the first wave of boats to hit the Normandy beaches .

        "document": "A Queensland grandmother, banned from any contact with children after being charged with the attempted murder of her two step-grandchildren, has moved into an apartment across the road from two schools after being released on bail this week. The woman, 58, allegedly tried to kill the two boys, aged nine and 11, by setting fire to their bedroom with an accelerant and 'intentionally impeding' their escape route. She has been been charged with four counts of attempted murder of children, attempted arson and interfering with a corpse in a Morayfield home, north of Brisbane, between April 2013 and September 2014. The Courier-Mail has now revealed the grandmother has moved within metres of Ipswich West Primary School and a special school, after her release from Brisbane Women\u2019s Correctional Centre on bail this week. Scroll down for video . 'The last photo of me and my grandson': The grandmother of the youngest child who died in Queensland's 'house of horrors' claimed he was murdered . The alleged crimes all occurred at a home in Morayfield, north of Brisbane, when the grandmother was present . In January, the Queensland Magistrates court granted the woman bail on the condition she find somewhere to live where she would have no contact with anyone under the age of 18. According to the the Courier Mail, angry parents outside the Queensland schools yesterday were demanding to know why they hadn't been informed and for the grandmother to be moved. The woman's laywer, Michael Bosscher, said one of the conditions of his client\u2019s bail was that she had no direct contact with children but said the court didn't consider the move a risk. 'The court, when hearing her bail application, was aware of the proximity of the primary school and, given the nature of the charges, doesn\u2019t consider her to be any particular risk to children,' \u00a0Mr Bosscher said. Horror scene: Queensland police recreated the moment the children, aged nine and 11, were nearly murdered in their beds by a deliberately lit fire . Firefighters remove the bed from the makeshift home. Police believe the children were deliberately blocked from exiting their bedroom . Detectives allege the grandmother tried to kill her two step grandsons, aged 9 and 11, by using an accelerant to set fire to a bed and holding their bedroom door closed. The children survived the fire with burns to their lower limbs, but a forensic recreation of the arson attack led detectives to believe someone had deliberately blocked their escape route from the bedroom. Police say the woman had twice before tried to suffocate the 11-year-old with a pillow and a tea towel as he slept. 'To have it happen to defenceless children is just mind-boggling,' said Detective Acting Superintendent Damien Hansen of the crimes. Police have also accused the grandmother of killing a three-year-old boy in 2013, and a seven-month old baby, her grandson, in the same 'house of horrors' in 2014. At the time, the younger children's deaths were explain as SIDS [Sudden Infant Death Syndrome] but police say the grandmother, who was present at the Morayfield home when both children died, had moved the baby from her own bedroom to make it look like he had died in a cot. The father of the three-year-old, who had separated from the boy's mother,\u00a0pleaded in 2013 for anyone with information to come forward and help police. '(My son) was a really healthy little boy,' he said at the time. 'When I got the call that night he was at the hospital, something didn\u2019t add up - he was a healthy three-year-old boy. 'How did my little buddy die?\u2019 Asked previously by Seven News  if she had killed her grandchildren, the woman replied: 'Absolutely not. I\u2019m not a heartless person. Someone with no heart would do that. Father and son: The father of the three-year-old boy police believe was murdered by his step grandmother wants justice for the dead toddler . The father of a toddler police believe was murdered on July 27 last year at the birth of his son. All four boys are  children of the same mother, but her most recent partner was father to the seven-month-old boy who died in September 2014. The two boys who survived the fire remain in the care of their mother and stepfather under supervision. Police say the pair are not suspected of being involved. But the father of the boys, who sees them sporadically, said he 'feared for their lives' every day they are in the house. 'Just mindboggling': Detective Acting Superintendent Damien Hansen said the crimes were horrific . The incidents, described by police as 'mind-boggling' each occurred on the 27th day of different months. Investigations into the younger children's deaths are ongoing and police are seeking legal advice on an appeal of the  Court's decision of bail for the grandmother involved.

        "document": "(CNN)A chiseled boxer's Instagram feed shows him making constant references to the Bible and enjoying gospel singing with his wife. Another features his formidable opponent counting stacks of money, hanging out in strip clubs, and flashing diamond watches and Ferraris. Welcome to the world of boxing promotion, circa 2015. American Floyd Mayweather and Filipino Manny Pacquiao are set to officially announce their heavily anticipated boxing match at a press conference in Los Angeles Wednesday. With the combined purse for the May 2 bout in Las Vegas reported to touch $300 million pending viewership numbers, the incentives to self-promote could not be higher. \"Nowadays you have to be on social media to launch the fight and to build hype,\" says boxing promoter Nisse Sauerland, CEO of Team Sauerland. \"It couldn't be done without it.\" Thirty-eight year old Mayweather (47-0, 26 knockouts), who favors the moniker \"The Money Man\" or \"TBE\" (The Best Ever), boasts nearly five million Instagram followers, 5.65 million followers on Twitter and 9.2 million Facebook likes. He famously confirmed the fight via Shots, a photo sharing social media application that he's invested in, and displays links to his clothing brand, The Money Team, on all his accounts. Along with professing to the be the best fighter of all time, he could also stake a claim to be one of the greatest social media users in sports. \"I think they're both playing their roles,\" says Sauerland, who promotes over 45 boxers. \"You've got the bad guy and the good guy, really. You've got the guy who throws the money around (Mayweather), that's his image, and Pacquiao, he's the hope of a nation.\" Although Pacquiao (57-5-2, 38 knockouts) also sports millions of followers, his social media numbers lag behind that of his opponent. The 36-year-old Filipino counts 1.7 million followers on Twitter and just 647,000 on Instagram, although his popularity on Facebook is much closer, with 6.3 million page likes. Has this disparity had an impact on Pacquiao's share of the fight's heady purse, which is reported to be split 60/40 in favor of Mayweather? \"If you have five million Twitter followers it does give you power in negotiation, because it reflects popularity, \" says Sauerland. \"But Mayweather needs Pacquiao too; you need  a storyline to make a good fight ... (Pacquiao) is the route to make it the biggest purse in history.\" The disparity is probably due to Pacquiao's less flashy posts. Without exception, they show him in training, in church, or with family -- always with a nod to Jesus in the text -- as well as his nationality, says sports media consultant Daniel McLaren and Cast Digital chief executive officer. \"Manny is a little bit more of a private person; he's not going to be as outspoken and give away as much, so he's always going to have a smaller following,\" he says, while noting that Instagram is less popular outside of North America and Europe. Pacquiao's followers in his home country are more likely to track his moves on Facebook and Twitter, adds McLaren. Either way, both fighters are likely to experience a surge in followers. \"If the only place you can find out what's happening behind the scenes in the lead-up to the fight is via their social media feeds, you're going to follow them,\" McLaren says. \"So I think they will see quite a big increase in followers and the amount of mentions they're getting as the fight gets closer.\" Athletes who participate in individual sports are more inclined to be active on social media, says McLaren, because they don't receive regular salaries, and product endorsements can be a much larger portion of their income. \"A boxer or a golfer or a tennis player has to use it as a commercial platform or a brand building platform,\" he says. \"If you have the choice between a different number of athletes to sponsor, and one has a million Instagram followers while the other doesn't go on social media, then it's a no-brainer.\" Sauerland agrees. \"Every fighter nowadays should be on social media, and if they're not, then they're not doing a good enough job at promoting themselves,\" he says. \"It doesn't matter who you are, whether you're a club fighter or a superstar.\" \"It'll be an interesting fight,\" adds McLaren, \"just because they are so different.\"",

        "document": "Former German leader Helmut Schmidt today\u00a0stunned his countrymen by revealing\u00a0he cheated on his wife during their 68-year marriage. The disclosure came when extracts of his new autobiography were printed in a German magazine. 'I had a relationship with another woman,' said Schmidt, who lost his wife Loki five years ago. Schmidt, 96, revealed his deepest personal secret in his book What I Still Want To Say, which is being serialised by the magazine Stern. He would not reveal the identity of his mistress nor how long the affair lasted. Former German Chancellor Helmut Schimdt  has admitted to having an affair during his 68-year marriage to Loki (pictured, above, with her husband in 2009) sometime in the late 60s or early 70s . 'It was at the end of the 60s or the beginning of the 70s,' he said, adding that his wife found out about it. He said she realised how 'close' it was and offered to leave him. 'I told her that was a totally fallacious idea,' he added. According to Stern, the woman was a colleague in the social democrat party which he led. He remained in contact with her 'for a long while' after the break up and attended her funeral two years ago. Back in the day: Schmidt (left) is pictured with then-British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on St Giorgio's Island for a summit of leaders of the European Economic Community in 1980 . Following the death of his wife, he began a relationship with Ruth Loah, 81, his long-time secretary and they are still together. 'Ruth saved my life,' said Schmidt, who was chancellor of Germany from 1974 until 1982. During his time as West Germany's chancellor he lead the country through Cold War tensions and a bloody wave of terror by far-left radicals, the Red Army Faction. He won the Iron Cross for his services in WWII which included action on both the eastern and western fronts. Last year, he revealed he had stashed 38,000 menthol cigarettes in his home because of fears the EU would try to ban them. He is well known for being excused for smoking in places where it is banned. Der Spiegel reported that the 40-a-day smoker has in the past managed to get away with it both in television studios and congress halls.",

Chris Kerrigan was having coffee at a caf\u00e9 in Portland, on the south-west coast of Victoria, on Monday when she noticed the tiny marsupial walking along the footpath. Ms Kerrigan posted a video of the koala on Facebook which has received more than 180,000 views. She said that a young boy who was with his mother at the same caf\u00e9 jumped up to take a photo of the koala, and the koala seemed to oblige. An adorable video has surfaced of a koala stopping to pose for a little boy's photo in Portland, Victoria . Chris Kerrigan was having coffee at a caf\u00e9 in Portland, on the south-west coast of Victoria, on Monday when she noticed the tiny marsupial walking along the footpath . 'The boy had a camera in his hand and wanted to take a photo,' Ms Kerrigan told Daily Mail Australia. 'He sat down as if to say \"Righto hurry up and take your photo.\" 'It was really interesting he wasn't the least bit phased by people around him, he looked quite calm.' In the video the koala can be seen casually strolling past shops. He then stops in front of a small blonde boy who is holding a camera phone and waits for him to take a picture before continuing his walk. Ms Kerrigan said after she stopped filming the koala crossed the road  before climbing a tree. Ms Kerrigan, who has only recently moved to the area from South Australia, has heard that it was not uncommon to see koalas on the outskirts of the town. Ms Kerrigan said she had only recently moved to the area from South Australia, but she had since heard that it was not uncommon to see koalas on the outskirts of the town . Ms Kerrigan posted a video of the koala on Facebook which has received more than 180,000 views . 'There seems to be quite a large koala population because of the vegetation around Portland,' she said, . 'But it's not that common to see them walking down the footpath.' The cute video follows reports that hundreds of koalas have been killed in secret by wildlife officials in Victoria due to concerns over starvation. The Victorian government euthanised 686 koalas at Cape Otway, on the same stretch of coast but about 250km west of Portland, in 2013 and 2014 in response to overpopulation in manna gum woodlands in the area. The koalas were killed via lethal injection after being captured in trees. Animal activists are furious and have condemned the government for their 'cruel' treatment of koalas and questioned why the program was conducted in secret. Mr Kerrigan said the koala he wasn't the least bit phased by people around hi and looked 'quite calm' Ms Kerrigan said after she stopped filming the koala crossed the road by the foreshore with a group of people before climbing a tree .",

        "document": "Sydney Siege survivor Marcia Mikhael has revealed she contemplated suicide after she was the victim of an online hate campaign, where people accused her of cashing in on her terrifying ordeal. Ms Mikhael was one of 18 people who were held hostage on December 15 by gunman Man Haron Monis for almost 17 hours inside the Lindt cafe at Martin Place in Sydney's CBD. She and other victims of the siege were reportedly paid to tell their stories on rival networks Channel Seven and Channel Nine in January. Scroll down for video . Marcia Mikhael appeared in an interview on Channel Seven back in January and told of her ordeal during the Sydney Siege . Man Haron Monis held 18 people hostage inside the Lindt cafe in Sydney on December 15 . Ms Mikhael told the Blacktown Sun\u00a0was bullied online after her lawyer told media she wanted a six-figure sum to tell her story in a television appearance. 'I went from being a victim and a hero to a villain, police basher,' the mother-of-three said. 'When all the bullying started I actually thought about killing myself. 'Every single one of the hostages received a payout from either Channel Seven or Nine. So why am I the only greedy monster?' Ms Mikhael said she had donated an unspecified amount of money from her television appearance and magazine interview to mental health service Lifeline. The Westpac project manager also revealed she had flashbacks and nightmares about the siege. Ms Mikhael said she had been slammed on social media, accused of profiting out of her terrifying experience . Katrina Dawson (right), who died in the siege, and Ms Mikhael were forced to stand side-by-side in the window on December 15 . She said she did not trust people anymore and was 'terrified' to go out. The 43-year-old added she had undergone two surgeries on each leg to remove more than 200 pieces of shrapnel. One of her comments during her interview on Channel Seven, which drew the most controversy, was how she thought the army could have handled it better than the NSW police who she said could have been more proactive in their approach. Ms Mikhael told the Blacktown Sun those comments had been taken out of context, adding she had thanked the police for saving her early on in the interview. Hostage victim Elly Chen (pictured running from the cafe on December 15) appeared alongside Ms Mikhael on Channel Seven in January . Jieun Bae was also interview who said Marcia Mikhael was a brave woman during the Sydney Siege . The former bodybuilder believes her road to recovery will be a long one but she was forcing herself back into her old routine. In January during her Channel Seven appearance, Ms Mikhael told reporter Mel Doyle how she shouted out to officers to let them know where she was on the floor, next to Katrina Dawson. When Monis fired the deadly shot to the back of Tori Johnson's head, Ms Mikhael and Ms Dawson were side-by-side, and also in the firing line. 'As soon as the second shot took place, and she looked at me, and then she puts her hands on her face and she puts her face down, like to protect her face. 'And I kind of go into a foetal position, you know, and my legs get hit. Both legs were in agony.' Ms Dawson and Mr Johnson were two of three people killed during the siege. Monis was the third person who died when police stormed the building after hearing gunshots.",

        "document": "I don't know how it happened, but suddenly my daughter Valentina is about to turn 18. I wanted to spend some time together - just the two of us - before she flies the nest. We've always lived in London, but Valentina has a keen interest in the animal world and longed to know more about the mysterious orca whale. We decided we would see these magnificent creatures in their natural habitat. Skimming the internet, I found a site called Sea Kayak Adventures, offering a five-day sea kayaking trip in the middle of August in northern British Columbia, Canada. Fins couldn't be better for Julietta in her kayak in the Johnstone Strait in Canada . We would kayak to base camp on the Johnstone Strait and from there take daily excursions, paddling among the pods of orcas that come back year after year during the months of July and August. The website said there would be a 97 per cent chance of seeing an orca during these two months. I booked immediately. The weekend before our departure, a kit list arrived by email. It was also clear from our itinerary that we would be without any showers, hot water, electrical power or wi-fi during our time in the wilderness. We were told to bring fast-drying synthetic clothes and whittle our possessions down to the essentials. Valentina insisted on bringing her camera equipment, which turned out to be a wise choice. We flew to Vancouver, took a small aircraft to Port Hardy, and then drove to Telegraph Cove. Even the experience of preparing for the expedition was exciting. Valentina, who normally expresses all the usual teenage behaviour and reactions, could not have been a more delightful and relaxed travel companion. We laughed out loud when we were given our two tiny watertight kitbags, which would contain our only belongings for the next five days and which we would carry in our kayak. When they 'breach', they jump fully out of the water; a 'spy hop' involves them having a quick look around to see what's going on; and at night they 'fin slap', which sounds like a gun going off . Our group also included a couple, a single man, Joe, and two excellent guides, Julia and Qui. We set off from Telegraph Cove after a briefing on safety, security and weather conditions. On that first day, we kayaked down the strait to a beautiful stony beach where we ate lunch - salad, eggs, ham, cheese and fruit - prepared by Julia and Qui. Afterwards, as we headed back towards camp, we found ourselves right in the path of a pod. They were moving quickly towards us, occasionally with their fins above the water and 'blowing' through their noses. Watching these animals glide majestically through the water was breathtaking. The guide had asked us to 'raft' our kayaks together so that we could make a larger body in the water above them. They submerged about 300ft in front of us, and I hardly dared breathe as they swam beneath us. I could have reached out and touched them. From that moment on we realised that humans really do not belong in a place like the Johnstone Strait. The animal kingdom was around us at all times: sea lions, humpback whales, bald eagles, jellyfish, dolphins, porpoises. Kayakers raft their vessels together as a killer whale approaches in the Johnstone Strait . This was their world, not ours. Our base camp was beautiful, our tent pitched just a few yards from the beach. Our bathroom, meanwhile, was a makeshift wooden cubicle some distance away in the woods. We quickly fell asleep on our first night, but I awoke with a start to what sounded like a bear cracking through the undergrowth. A few minutes later I realised it was squirrels high up in the trees above throwing nuts and cones down on to our tent. Julia and Qui laughed at me, and assured me that bears and cougars are a very rare sight in Telegraph Cover. Valentina and I spent five extraordinary days in the Johnstone Strait. The water was calm and the sun shone brightly. We tracked pods every day. At times they would come and scratch their backs just yards from the beach at our base camp. In the morning the whales would gun down the Strait as if they were on the school run, then at dusk they would drift back slowly, as if they were heading home at the end of a busy day. We soon learned something of their habits. When they 'breach', they jump fully out of the water; a 'spy hop' involves them having a quick look around to see what's going on; and at night they 'fin slap', which sounds like a gun going off. Julietta and her group at the water's edge at\u00a0Telegraph Cove near Port Hardy . Our guides told us not to be frightened as no one has ever been hurt, let alone killed, by a whale in the Johnstone Strait. Julia had a microphone that goes underwater and when the whales were close we could listen to them communicating with each other as any family would do. It was a deeply emotional experience to hear them conversing, especially knowing the terrible isolation they experience in confinement and captivity. The local whale-watching boats know the pods well. Each pod has a name and can be distinguished by the sound of their communication under the water - each family makes different sounds. Every day was more beautiful than the last. We became calm and relaxed among the whales, waiting for them to reappear, then easing back in our kayaks to take photographs. We grew accustomed to the quiet, and it was a relief to be far away from home, with no access to emails or phones. On our final night after dinner we added to the collected sculpture of pebbles left by previous kayakers - stones rendered heart-shaped by the lap of the waves. I asked Valentina if she had ever been in a situation where there was no wi-fi, no connectivity, and no communication with her friends - a time when she was simply a human being in the stillness of our planet. She said that while she missed talking to her friends and sharing her experiences, she actually found it deeply relaxing not to have to listen to the constant chatter. On the final night I was desperate for a shower. Without one, I opted for the next best thing - a dip in the freezing sea. It crossed my mind that I was swimming in Mother Nature's pool. Julietta and Valentina came face to face with a black bear during their trip . The next morning I walked alone down to the creek to take in the unbelievable beauty of our surroundings one last time. That's when I spotted a big black bear right in front of me, grunting through his huge nostrils. As soon as he saw me he started to lollop away into the undergrowth. I stood still, then shouted to Valentina that she should come outside with her camera. The bear hung around just long enough for her to take an out-offocus photograph. An adventure like this was made much more special for me because I shared it with my daughter. Travelling can be stressful, but we were almost always in good spirits, and in harmony with one another. We have memories that will never leave us. To have an experience like that with my daughter who will soon embark on adult life was something I shall treasure for ever. I know she enjoyed every second of it too. GETTING THERE . Sea Kayak Adventures (seakayakadventures.com) offers a six-day Blackfish Waters Orca Kayak tour from US$1,545pp (about \u00a31,025).

        "document": "When Nick Clegg walked out of today's farcical \u2018yellow budget\u2019 speech, it prompted relentless jeers from Labour MPs - and left Danny Alexander speaking to a virtually-empty chamber. And, to add insult to injury, the Deputy Prime Minister's swift exit appeared to be for the sole purpose of trying his hand at a spot of Am-dram in Gravesend. As these pictures show, the Liberal Democrat leader was this afternoon seen sauntering around Kent, taking selfies with residents and high-fiving passers-by as part of a 'fun' film shoot for a party political broadcast. Scroll down for video . High five: Nick Clegg was spotted in Gravesend, Kent, high-fiving passers-by (left) - and himself (right) - as part of a 'fun' political party broadcast . 'Fun': The Deputy Prime Minister said he did not want the election campaign to be too 'po-faced' and serious . Selfie: As part of the filming, Mr Clegg, who left the Commons early, stopped to pose for selfies with residents . Am-dram: He also practised his best acting outside a nail art studio (left) and with another selfie taker (right) Wearing dark woollen gloves, an open-neck shirt and a navy v-neck sweater, Mr Clegg looked right at home as he laughed and joked with residents, putting on his best smiling face for the cameras and occasionally treating them to an embrace. There were even reports that he interacted with dancing girls for the film. At one point, Mr Clegg opted for an outfit swap, changing into a camel-coloured jacket, which he matched with a more severe facial expression, as he walked solo along the high street. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the political broadcast is not the first time that Mr Clegg has attempted some amateur acting. The politician is said to have enjoyed Am-dram at school, taking the lead role in The Government Inspector while at Caldicott. At Westminster, \u00a0he took the lead in The Changeling, opposite Hollywood actress in-the-making Helena Bonham Carter. In one scene, she had to kick him between the legs - and one night she hit the target rather too authentically. 'She got it spot on\u2026 no acting was required,' Clegg recalls. He also once donned a purple velvet jacket to play Charles Condomine in Noel Coward's Blithe Spirit - a man who boasts about his sexual conquests. Woollen: Wearing woolly gloves, an open-neck shirt and a v-neck sweater, Mr Clegg looked right at home . Swap: He even opted for an outfit change halfway through filming, reverting to a camel-coloured jacket . Strutting his stuff: Mr Clegg is a seasoned amateur actor and took the lead role in The Government Inspector while at Caldicott . Speaking to KentOnline about today's filming, Mr Clegg said: 'It's a bit of fun. I want to have fun in this general election campaign. I don't want it to be too po-faced and serious.' Asked why the party decided to shoot the video in Gravesend, he added: 'It was just a really great place to do this and hopefully not cause too much disruption. 'Everybody in the shops here have been really warm and really generous with their time.' A Lib Dem source said: 'We were filming bits of a party political broadcast and other videos that are going to be used in the campaign. 'The whole crew has been filming for a couple of days \u2013 Nick was there for a couple of hours today. 'But you'll just have to wait and see what's in them.'",

        "document": "Barcelona may never have been here today. Not the team harboring the awesome power of Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez up front. Not the club who have won four European Cups and so many domestic trophies they require a small cave rather than a mere cabinet to hold them. Irishman Patrick 'Paddy' O'Connell is credited with rescuing Barcelona from extinction . The awesome trio of Neymar, Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez may not have been assembled if not for O'Connell . Not Luis Enrique's side who are aiming to knock Manchester City out of the last 16 of the Champions League. All of that is unlikely to have existed were it not for Irishman Patrick 'Paddy' O'Connell, who as a player captained the red side of Manchester during five years at United from 1914 but has inadvertently played a crucial role in setting up City's two-legged fixture with Barcelona a century later. O'Connell is credited with rescuing Barcelona from extinction during his time in charge between 1935 and 1940. Barcelona have enjoyed great success in recent years but it was O'Connell that saved the club . In Spain, he became known as 'Don Patricio' - a title reserved for royalty or noblemen - for his successes after moving over aged 35 and first leading Racing de Santander to five regional titles before becoming one of the founding members of La Liga. He took charge at Real Oviedo and then won the Spanish title at Real Betis, but his greatest legacy was shaped when Barcelona came calling. After just one season at the Catalan club, the Spanish Civil War broke out in July 1936 and the country was in chaos. O'Connell (back row, far right) pictured for Ireland against Wales in 1914/1915 . On the streets of Barcelona, anarchy was escalating. As the tanks rolled in, football was flattened in the country. La Liga was suspended and, despite playing in and winning the Mediterranean League, cash was running out fast. The club were facing financial ruin. O'Connell orchestrated himself and the players taking a huge wage cut - reducing his salary by a third from $1,500 to $1,000 - but Barcelona were still heading out of business, until the wily Irishman had a bright idea. Barcelona celebrate with the Champions League trophy following victory over Manchester United in 2009 . Former Barcelona captain and defender Carles Puyol  holds the Champions League trophy in Rome . He took the team on a tour of Mexico and America, playing 14 games and raising $5,000 - the equivalent of $83,000 today. It was little, but enough to survive. By the time the war ended in April 1939, O'Connell had dragged the team back from the brink of oblivion. Why then would this Barca legend  come to die alone and penniless in London 20 years later? While O'Connell is remembered so fondly in those sunnier climes, on our own shores an entirely different character is recalled by those he should have loved dearest. 'He was the hero in one way but also the swine who left his family in poverty,' his grandson Mike remembered. 'There are two sides to it, a sad family story, but I'm proud he was my grandfather.' O'Connell (back row, one from the left) as part of the Hull City team in 1913-14 . O'Connell was a gambler and a misogynist; a chancer, swindler and trickster. He played for Belfast Celtic, Sheffield Wednesday and Hull City before impressing Manchester United enough for them to pay \u00a31,000 for his services in May 1914. The same year he captained Ireland to the British Home Championship, playing the final game against Scotland with a broken arm. O'Connell was a brash, brazen, no-nonsense centre-back and was made captain of United straight away. However, the first season was a catastrophe and they avoided relegation from Division One by a single point. Even worse - a victory against Liverpool in April was deemed fixed. Puyol holds up the Club World Cup trophy after victory against Santos FC at the tournament in Yokohama . Sandy Turnbull and Enoch 'Knocker' West photographed in 'cricketing' pose at Old Trafford in 1911 . The First World War had broken out and no football was to be played the following season. A group of United and Liverpool players, fearing unemployment and what the future held, met in a pub the day before the game and agreed to the more unlikely 2-0 United win and bet on it at odds of seven-to-one. The scam was uncovered when the Football Association investigated claims of a lack of effort from Liverpool players. United's Sandy Turnbull, Enoch West, Arthur Whalley, and Liverpool's Thomas Fairfoul, Tom Miller, Bob Pursell and Jackie Sheldon were banned indefinitely by the FA. Former Barca man Cesc Fabregas holds the  UEFA Super Cup after beating Porto at Louis II Stadium . Bob Pursell was banned after rigging a game to win money when Liverpool faced Manchester United . Liverpool's Jackie Sheldon was one of those players banned indefinitely by the FA . Liverpool's Thomas Fairfoul was also banned for his part in the corrupt game between the rival teams . O'Connell struck a penalty well wide with the score at 2-0, but somehow avoided punishment. Yet O'Connell's family admit that maverick streak ran through him. It was these scrapes and scraps which shaped an eventual legend. 'He was an incredible success as a footballer but as a man he was probably a bit of loveable rogue,' Mike's wife Sue explained. 'As a father he was a non-starter.' He remained a United player through the war and after it ended had a year at Dumbarton before moving to Ashington in 1920. David Beckham is one of 40 players who have supported a fund  to raise money for a fitting memorial . O'Connell was determined to find success in football and would let nothing stand in his way. Not even family. He left his wife Ellen at Newcastle station in 1920 after she had travelled there to plead with him to return home. It was the last time O'Connell would see her and he married again in Spain, another Irishwoman called Ellen. At Ashington, he was made player-manager and had his first taste in running a club, before the sniff of adventure took him abroad. Johan Cruyff has also supported the plea to get O'Connell a more fitting memorial following his death . But for all his heroics in Spain, when O'Connell returned to England in 1958 he faded into destitution before he died in London a year later where he remains in an unmarked grave. Last year, a fund was set up to raise money for a more fitting memorial. So far, more than 40 notable football names have supported it, including Sir Bobby Charlton, Johan Cruyff, Franz Beckenbauer, Paolo Maldini and David Beckham. There is a bust of O'Connell in the FC Barcelona Museum. There, he will always be remembered as the man who saved the club. AC Milan legend Paolo Maldini is one of more than 40 players to support the memorial idea .",

        "document": "Branko Loncar, 55, won a long legal battle against being returned to Croatia to serve four years in prison for attempted murder . A man who shot his dying wife 14 times as she was hanging from a noose can continue to live freely in Britain \u2013 after judges refused to extradite him. Branko Loncar, 55, has won a long legal battle against being returned to Croatia to serve four years in prison for attempted murder, despite committing further crimes, including an assault, while living in London. He earlier won asylum after complaining he had to flee Croatia because of anti-Serb discrimination \u2013 and his lawyers argued locals would persecute him over the shooting. Last week\u2019s High Court ruling is a sharp reminder that while the Government talks of ejecting foreign criminals, in practice the criminals routinely win the right to stay here. Loncar, who has been on benefits and had a drink problem since arriving in Britain with his two sons in 1999, made the extraordinary defence that he was not aiming at his wife when he fired repeatedly from a few yards away. In any case, his lawyers claimed, she died as a result of hanging herself, not because of the 14 bullets he \u2018accidentally\u2019 fired into her defenceless body. A Croatian court which heard the case in his absence rejected his defence, sentenced him to four years in prison, and ten years ago the country formally issued an international arrest warrant and requested his extradition from Britain. His lawyers first successfully fought against the extradition on human rights grounds, arguing that he had a new Serbian \u2018partner\u2019 in Britain \u2013 who actually lives a hundred miles away \u2013 and that he now had grandchildren in London. And last week British judges finished off the extradition bid for ever, giving Loncar the right to remain free here, after ruling it \u2018oppressive\u2019 to send him back to prison in Croatia after so long. He was also commended for raising his children alone after shooting his wife. Speaking in broken English to the Daily Mail last night at his housing association flat close to fashionable Camden in North London, Loncar said he had every right to remain in Britain, adding: \u2018Croatia is dangerous \u2013 they still want me there.\u2019 The case began in 1994, amid the chaos of the Balkan wars, when Loncar, an ethnic Serb and former soldier in the Yugoslavian army, lived with his wife Mirjana and two sons in the village of Ostrovo. The area was declared part of a Serbian republic but was also claimed by Croatia. UK court documents note: \u2018After a quarrel with his wife Mirjana, she went out of the house, stood on a ladder, took a rope and indicated she intended to kill herself. As she stood from the ladder and the noose tightened around her neck and rendered her unconscious, the defendant fired a number of bullets into her body. \u2018The cause of death was determined to be by strangulation but was accelerated by the injuries inflicted from the defendant\u2019s gun. The defendant was charged with murder.\u2019 The subsequent trial \u2013 by a Serbian court \u2013 heard that Loncar had fired 14 shots from his handgun \u2018causing a number of injuries\u2019. Last week, British judges finished off the extradition bid for ever, giving Loncar the right to remain free in the UK, by ruling in the High Court (pictured) that it would be \u2018oppressive\u2019 to send him back to prison in Croatia . He told the court \u2018that when he saw that his wife had jumped off the ladder, he took the gun and ammunition out of the holster he had under his arm and fired the gun from three to four metres away, but did not know in which direction.\u2019 After a single pathologist claimed Mrs Loncar had already died of strangulation before being shot, he was initially cleared of murder. In 1999 he then flew to England with his children and successfully claimed asylum, saying that his ethnic Serbian children were discriminated against by Croatians at school \u2013 but also complaining of \u2018local antipathy resulting from the death of his wife\u2019. While he began a life on benefits here, Croatia\u2019s supreme court in 2000 ordered a retrial, with Loncar\u2019s village now a part of Croatia, and the following year he was convicted in his absence of attempted murder. Four doctors said Mrs Loncar was still alive when her husband shot her. He was given a four-year prison sentence on the grounds that he \u2018had an intention to kill\u2019. Croatia, a member of the European Union, some years later sought Loncar\u2019s extradition, and in 2006 British police arrested him. A UK court swiftly rejected the request, noting with sympathy that he had to bring up his children alone after shooting his wife. But in 2014 he was arrested again, and although he was immediately freed on bail the case was sent to the High Court in London. Last week\u2019s High Court judgment in Loncar\u2019s favour, by judges Lord Justice Aiken and Mrs Justice Popplewell, the conclusion of the long legal battle, noted: \u2018The offence for which the extradition of Mr Loncar is sought is undoubtedly a very serious one. Moreover, Mr Loncar has not led a blameless life as a British citizen. \u2018He has a caution for theft in 2012 and a conviction for common assault in 2013. Nevertheless we have reached the firm conclusion that it would be oppressive to extradite Mr Loncar by reason of the passage of time.\u2019 The ruling was also sharply critical of the Croatian legal system, and observed that he had served a year in prison before being initially cleared almost 20 years ago. And in reference to the Human Rights Act\u2019s \u2018right to a family life\u2019 clause, judges said Loncar had \u2018been in a relationship with the same partner since prior to 2006, although they do not live together\u2019. Far from living together, the Daily Mail has discovered that \u2018partner\u2019 helping provide him with a \u2018family life\u2019 to maintain here is an ethnic Serb born in Britain and living 100 miles from him in Leicester.",

Officers met \"complete chaos\" when they tried to find out what happened not long after midnight Friday, Sheriff Frank McKeithen told CNN affiliate WMBB when interviewed on the scene. Video showed the streets teeming with young people. Three people with gunshot wounds were found inside a house, one outside the house, one in the median of the road and two on the other side of the road, the sheriff's office said in a press release. \"We have about 100 witnesses or so that we are trying to separate and interview,\" McKeithen told WMBB.  \"We have a mess.\" The scene was so mixed up that deputies from five adjacent counties and officers from the Florida Highway Patrol and Panama City Beach police were called in to assist. The shooting occurred at a residence on Thomas Drive, the main drag in the beach town. Several of the victims were students from Alabama A&M University who were visiting town for spring break, the sheriff's office said. They're between 20 and 22 years of age. During February and March, up to six million young people visit Panama City Beach, which some have been dubbed \"the Spring Break Capital of the World.\" The Panhandle town has a resident population of about 12,000. Some of the young people were shot multiple times. They were taken to area hospitals, where three were listed in critical condition and three in stable condition, the sheriff's office said. The seventh person was in surgery when the press release was issued and no update on his condition was provided. Authorities arrested David Jarmichael Daniels, 22, of Mobile, Alabama, on seven counts of attempted murder. A .40-caliber pistol was found in the backyard of a residence. Officials did not mention a possible motive. The shooting was one of six firearms-related incidents of the night, with four guns seized in drug cases, the sheriff's office said in a press release. Other details were not provided. On Saturday night, the Panama City Beach City Council held a special meeting to talk about the violence. \"It's time to stop the bloodshed,\" said council member Keith Curry, according to WMBB. \"We're lucky that we don't have seven dead people.\" \"This is a hostile takeover, an attempt at a hostile takeover,\" said Sparky Sparkman, owner of Spinnaker Beach Club. \"And if anyone here doesn't think what's going on out there is hostile, just ride up and down the street.\" The council considered banning alcohol on the beach through mid-April, but that measure was voted down, WMBB said. The council approved more funding for extra enforcement on the beach.",

        "document": "A mother who was jointly awarded \u00a31.5 million damages after an alcoholic nurse swapped her daughter at birth, has spoken of her pain at being trolled for not recognising her daughter. The woman, who wants to remain anonymous, told how she cried herself to sleep over nasty online messages, accusing her of lacking proper maternal feelings. She was one of two mothers and families whose lives were devastated when their babies were accidentally mixed up at a Cannes clinic in 1994. Trolling victim: The woman, who does not want to be identified and pictured here with her solicitor, has since been abused online for not recognising her own child . Internet trolls attacked her for failing to notice the complexion of her daughter was wrong when she and her husband were both Creoles. 'So many mothers were insisting that it was impossible not to recognise your own child,' she said. 'These horrible messages made me suffer more from my own feelings of guilt. I wanted to scream. 'Nothing was stopping me from turning off the computer, so I was hurting myself all alone'. Both babies were being treated for jaundice when the tragic blunder occurred, the mistake of a nurse who Mailonline understands is now in a psychiatric hospital. Separated at birth: 'Stephanie's' biological daughter Manon was unwittingly given to Sophie Serrano who thought her darker complexion was due to her own Spanish heritage . Blunder: Baby Manon, pictured here with her non-biological mother Sophie, who had no idea she was holding another woman's baby, was placed under a lamp with another baby girl just after birth to cure her jaundice . The woman's biological daughter, Manon, now 21, is still living with the other mother Sophie Serrano, while she has continued to raise\u00a0Madame Serrano's biological daughter, Mathilde. Earlier this year, Madame Serrano told Mail Online how the unforgivable error had cost her her marriage when her husband refused to accept the daughter she brought home was his. The two families were awarded damages of 1.88 million euros between them by a French civil court after a ten-year fight to prove they were the innocent victims of a hospital mix-up. Now the second woman has decided to speak out about the anger and fear that swept over her when tests proved that both had taken the wrong children home. Using the alias of Stephanie in French newspaper\u00a0Nice Matin, she told how she was only 19 when she gave birth and had not long arrived from the Indian Ocean island of Reunion, a French territory. She explained that she and her husband, who met when they were 14, were Creoles and had no family with them on the Cote d'Azur. She had lost her parents as a child and was brought up by her grandmother. Stephanie said she did think her baby had changed when the nurse placed her back in her arms but this was quickly dismissed by staff. Teased: Manon was subjected to bullying taunts and whispers that she was the daughter of 'the postman' because her complexion was darker than her mother's. She is pictured above aged nine, just before she discovered the truth about her parentage and was left deeply traumatised . Then and now: Manon, pictured as a nine-year-old before she discovered she had been given to the wrong mother, left, and today aged 21. She wanted to stay with her non-biological mother but has since met with biological mum 'Stephanie' 'Only three little tufts of hair were left on her head', she said. 'I did smile as I told the nurse so, but there was a deep anxiety within me over an eventual mistake. 'She remarked sharply: ' Of course it is your baby'. The moment passed very quickly and I was alone. I reasoned that I was quite young and had faith in them.' Stephanie said she was devastated to learn the truth a decade later and worried that she would lose Mathilde. She was also naturally curious to find out about her biological daughter, Manon, and who she was living with. 'After learning the truth, I felt so angry, but above all frightened. The fear of people taking my child away after she had lived ten years with us. 'Then I wanted to know where my biological daughter was, which family she was in and to know her.' Sophie, left, described the moment she heard that Manon, right, was not her daughter:\u00a0'He is not the father,' the lawyer said, 'but you are not the mother either'. Both families have been awarded joint damages of \u00a31.5 million . She was then faced with heartbreaking job of telling Mathilde about the mistake. She went on: 'We took her aside in the living room, sat on the settee and explained to her as simply as possible. 'She said nothing at first and then, with us either side of her, she asked: 'Must I go to the other family? 'We told her that normally, no, but we did not know anything yet. Her reply was: 'In any case, you are my parents'. 'I was impressed by her reaction and still am by the manner in which she has handled it, often better than me even if it was very hard for her'. The two families eventually met in an emotional reunion for all involved. The mother continued: 'Things happened simply with a lot of tears. Mathilde discovered her brothers and sisters. 'Manon, my biological daughter, was acquainted with my children, who are her brothers and sisters'. Both girls, now 21, have been left so traumatised that neither envisage having children of their own in the future.",

        "document": "They may have split a year ago, but Prince Harry turned out to support his ex-girlfriend Cressida Bonas  for the opening night of her latest acting venture. The fourth-in-line to the throne was spotted in the audience last night for Cressida's return to the stage as female lead Cecily Cardew in Oscar Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest. He made a low-key entrance but was seen laughing throughout the comedy of manners at the London Oratory, a Catholic comprehensive which counts Nick Clegg's son as a pupil. Scroll down for video . Prince Harry turned out to support his ex-girlfriend Cressida Bonas for the opening night  of The Importance Of Being Earnest, pictured (centre, bottom) with other cast members . Cressida, 26, whose acting career has blossomed since she split from Harry last year, charmed the audience with her portrayal of the excitable and eccentric lead character. Wearing a flowing white dress and with her long hair in ringlets, her background as a dancer shone through as she gracefully bounded across the stage with infectious energy. In her tongue-in-cheek profile for the programme she was described as an 'actor, dancer and sky-diving enthusiast who was raised on a marsh by wolves'. It said: 'Accordingly, she has a vast litter of her own cubs which you may spot romping around the theatre later this evening (do not be alarmed, they're both very friendly and very stupid). The fourth-in-line\u00a0made a low-key entrance but was seen laughing throughout the comedy of manners starring his ex-girlfriend (right) His two-year relationship with Cressida came to an end last April, with a number of sources saying she was hoping to concentrate with her career . 'However, Cressida herself is a very clever little wolf, leaving audiences howling with laughter in her London stage debut earlier this year (Tallulah Brown's There's a Monster in the Lake).' The three-night production is being put on by Band of Others, a London-based theatre group which is raising funds for the Action on Addiction charity, which boasts Kate Middleton as a patron. Prince Harry, 30, wearing a dark blue long-sleeved jumper, did not make any attempt to remain incognito as he sat in the circle with a male friend. He was seen in hysterics at Harry Wright's portrayal of the indomitable Lady Bracknell and Harry Elgood's sophisticated depiction of lead character John Worthing. This comes days after the revelation that Prince Harry is planning to leave the Army to continue his mother's legacy with a number of charitable projects during his second 'gap year'. Speaking  about his choice to bring his active military career to an end, he said it was a 'really tough' decision and he was looking forward to starting a new chapter in his life. The three-night production is being put on by Band of Others\u00a0at the London Oratory (pictured), a Catholic comprehensive which counts Nick Clegg's son as a pupil . The budding actress has bagged a bit part in Tulip Fever (pictured), the forthcoming Judi Dench movie produced by Harvey Weinstein . Earlier today he joined Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge for the memorial service of\u00a0triple Olympic gold equestrian\u00a0Richard Meade. In a statement on his website, Prince Harry said: '[Richard] had huge successes in his career as a competitor but his greatest success was not in his achievements on a horse, but in the way he conducted himself \u2013 with generosity to others, genuine interest and a real sense of integrity, always standing up for what was morally right. 'He cared deeply about the sport and gave so much to both the eventing and wider horse world. Thank you for all the wonderfully supportive letters and messages and many apologies for only answering a small number of them so far.' His two-year relationship with Cressida came to an end last April, with a number of sources saying she was hoping to concentrate on her career. She graduated from the Laban school of dance and made her theatrical debut  in 2014 at Hay Festival in the play There's a Monster in the Lake. The budding actress has now bagged a bit part in Tulip Fever, the forthcoming Judi Dench movie produced by Harvey Weinstein, who declared her 'a fantastic actress'. She also recently  appeared in a sexy dance video for British designer Mulberry.",

        "document": "Playing with Thierry Henry turned Bradley Wright-Phillips into the MLS's top goal scorer last season. The duo had chemistry and the result was one of those seasons that will be hard to beat, with the Englishman scoring 27 goals in 32 games and winning the league's golden boot. Doing it again might be a lot tougher. Henry, the French international who brought immense talent and recognition to the league, has retired and Wright-Phillips is going to have to go through an adjustment period. Bradley Wright-Phillips (left) didn't have a shot in the Red Bulls' season opener against Sporting Kansas City . Thierry Henry retired at the end of the season meaning Wright-Phillips has a new strike partner . The Red Bulls have revamped their roster and Henry isn't the only one gone. Australian international Tim Cahill has departed along with fellow midfielder Eric Alexander. In the season opening tie against Sporting Kansas City, Wright-Phillips didn't have a shot. 'I don't have to readjust my game,' the 30-year-old Englishman said after the Red Bulls practiced for their home opener against D.C. United on Sunday. 'I am always going to play the same way I always have. The players that have come in, I'm trying to learn like I did with Thierry. I learned how he played and I learned to play off him. I'll try to do the same with the new guys.' The additions this season are midfielders Sacha Kljestan and Felipe Martins and striker Mike Grella. But in the 1-1 season-opening draw, the chemistry was lacking up front. 'On the day of the game I put a lot of it down to me,' Wright-Phillips said. 'I was a bit too eager to get behind. I could have done a little bit better with my runs. It's the first game, I don't really lose my mind after a first game of the season.' If there is a difference this season it's the style of the Red Bulls' play under new coach Jesse Marsch. There is an emphasis on moving the ball quickly with everybody contributing. A lot went through Henry in past seasons. The New York Red Bulls drew 1-1 with Sporting Kansas City in their first MLS game of the season . 'For us, it was almost a little unrealistic having a guy like Thierry on the team,' Red Bulls captain and midfielder Dax McCarty said. 'He was a little of a wild card, a joker. If you are losing or in a bad situation, you could just play him the ball and hope that something magical happened, which more often than not did. That's gone. I think this is a team that can hurt you in numerous ways and that's going to be a big shift this season. McCarty said the team could have helped Wright-Phillips more in the opening game. 'We didn't create enough chances for Bradley,' McCarty said. 'I think he will admit he can do a better job making better runs and we have a do a better job of looking for him and finding him when he does make those good runs. That is the thing that is going to make us successful this season. Wright-Phillips isn't heading into the season thinking: how does he top last year? He has set a goal target that he is not disclosing. If he meets it, he'll set another one. Whatever he does, Wright-Phillips isn't interested in heading back to England, where he played for Manchester City, Southampton, Plymouth Argyle, Charlton Athletic and Brentford before coming to the Red Bulls in July 2013. 'I don't want to go back to Europe. I've said that several times,' Wright-Phillips said. 'There were one or two whispers that I heard about but it doesn't interest me. I'm playing for the New York Red Bulls and I love living in New Jersey.' Wright-Phillips says he has no desire of coming back to England and is enjoying life in the USA .",

        "document": "One of the British twin sisters who have travelled to Syria to become jihadi brides was caught looking at an extremist-linked image on her school computer six months before she fled the country, it has emerged. Salma Halane, 17, downloaded a photograph of ISIS fighters in December 2013, using a computer at Connell Sixth Form College in Manchester. When teachers found out, she told them she was trying to find her brother who had gone to Syria. Terror: Salma Halane, left, looked up an image of ISIS fighters online six months before she travelled to Syria with her twin sister Zahra, right . Six months later, Salma and her twin sister Zahra fled to the war-torn country, where they are believed to have married jihadist fighters from the bloodthirsty terror group. The ISIS-related photograph which Salma viewed online was spotted by teachers when they were reviewing pupils' internet usage. The school says that she was twice spoken to by staff about the picture, and advised to talk to her family about her worries over her brother, while teachers subsequently discussed the issue with her parents. However, staff did not  tell the police of any concerns about the girl. After the twins disappeared in June last year, the school handed all their internet browsing records over to anti-terrorism investigators to help them track Salma and Zahra down. School: Connell Sixth Form College discovered the image on one of its own computers . Jihad: This picture of female ISIS fighters was shared by Salma on her Twitter feed after she went to Syria . A spokesman for Bright Futures Educational Trust, which runs the college, said there was no reason not to believe Salma's explanation for why she was viewing the image. She added: 'As part of the college's daily routine we review all internet browsing records. We promptly challenge students on anything that stands out during that review. 'In December 2013 we discovered that Salma Halane had viewed an image on a mainstream news website in the hope of spotting her missing brother. Our priority was her emotional wellbeing, and we recommended she speak to her mother about her concern for her brother and the college followed this up. 'Once it became clear that the girls had travelled to Syria, we handed over all computer records to the Counter Terrorism Unit (CTU). These were reviewed and nothing was discovered that caused them concern.' Training: Another image sent out by Salma appears to show women in burqas being taught how to shoot . An education source told the Manchester Evening News that the school should have done more to intervene after they saw that Salma had been looking at terror-related content online. 'I have no doubt whatsoever that if someone at the college had followed this up with Salma, she would still be in this country,' the source said. 'I think there should have been a real concern that she was becoming radicalised.' Salma and Zahra were among the first pupils at Connell Sixth Form College, which opened as a State-funded free school in September 2013. The twin girls, from the Manchester suburb of Chorlton, had 28 GCSEs between them and were hoping to become doctors before they ran away to join ISIS. Their parents tried to travel to Syria to bring the girls back home, but were unable to persuade them to leave the war zone. A number of British schoolgirls are believed to have left the country to become jihadi brides - last month, three teenagers from East London abandoned their families and travelled to Syria.",

        "document": "He's the internet-savvy modern leader who cuddles up to kittens and hobnobs with film stars on his wildly popular Instagram page. But Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov is also a former warlord accused of running the Russian republic 'like a medieval tyrant'. The 38-year-old came to power in 2007 after a vicious armed struggle with a number of other Chechen strongmen and a political battle with the man he succeeded as leader, Alu Alkhanov. Claims that Kadyrov keeps a 'murder list' of 300 names of people to be liquidated surfaced in 2008. Yet the brutal reality of how Kadyrov maintains his grip on power has been glossed over by his social media skills and voracious appetite for posting on Instagram. Scroll down for video . Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov with actress Liz Hurley and a kitten. The Austin Powers star was in Grozny to shoot thriller\u00a0Turquoise when the snap was taken in May 2013 . Kadyrov in medieval garb. He has posted on his Instagram account kadyrov_95 more than 4,800 times and has an incredible 905,000 followers . The former Chechen warlord lies down for a snooze with a pet tiger. Kadyrov is a fan of the big cats . The father-of-eight has uploaded more than 4,800 posts and has around 905,000 followers to his kadyrov_95 account on the photo-sharing site. He has shown a particular fondness for snaps of himself with cute fluffy kittens, baby birds, lambs and even tigers. In May 2013 he posted snaps of himself with Liz Hurley and a white kitten on Instagram after meeting the actress when she arrived in Chechnya to film thriller Turquoise with French actor Gerard Depardieu. The pair were seen  apparently bonding over the tiny animal having been introduced by Kadyrov's friend Depardieu. In another shot the Chechen strongman leans across the Austin Powers star and runs his finger over the smartphone she is holding as the two appear perfectly at ease with each other. Depardieu met the Chechen leader at his birthday celebrations two years previously and later controversially accepted Russian citizenship after quitting France to avoid a planned 75 per cent tax on millionaires. Left to right: Hurley, Gerard Depardieu and Kadyrov go walkabout in Grozny, where the actors were filming . The strongman's love of kittens is clear for all to see, while he and Hurley seemed to hit it off during her visit . Kadryrov, Hurley and Depardieu. The actor controversially accepted Russian citizenship after quitting France . Chechnya's president (right) and some of his cronies take to the streets of Grozny in a Rolls Royce . The two are seen laughing and joking out and about with Hurley in the Chechen capital Grozny. Kadyrov's fondness for the high life is revealed as the devout Muslim and some of his cronies are seen cruising through the streets of Grozny in a Rolls Royce. Things get weirder as he shows a fondness for medieval costume in another shot and poses with yet more fluffy cats perching on his shoulder and reclining in his arms. The burly enforcer has a go at playing the world's biggest softy as he lovingly cups a baby chick in his enormous hands. And the shots of him with a tiger are probably the most bizarre of all, as he pillows his head on the young big cat on top of an ornate rug and has it on his lap with a lead around its neck as he sits between two associates. And yet this is the man whose widely feared 'Kadyrovtsy' militia several thousand-strong, are accused by human rights groups of involvement in kidnappings, assassinations and torture throughout their patron's rise to power. They were formed during the first Chechen war for independence between 1994 and 1995 when Kadyrov's father, Chechnya's Grand Mufti or highest Islamic official, declared jihad against Russia. The former warlord (centre) and another bizarre snap of him with a tiger which even has lead round its neck .

He rules the once restive Russian republic with an iron fist . Chechnya's president with a baby chick. He also posted this kitten on his wildly popular Instagram account . But the Kadyrov clan switched their allegiance to Moscow at the beginning of the second Chechen war in 1999, since when continued insurgents against the Kremlin have been ruthlessly dealt with by the militia. The paramilitary clashed with forces loyal to fellow warlord Sulmin Yamadayev in March 2008 and a year later Kadyrov's rival was dead, assassinated in Dubai in a hit reputedly ordered by one of Kadyrov's cousins. The son of assassinated former Chechen president\u00a0Akhmad Kadyrov also prevailed in his fight with paramilitary leader Said-Magomed Kakiyev, while Kadyrov successfully angled for Russian President Vladimir Putin to dismiss Alkhanov and appoint him leader instead. Since then it is widely accepted that Putin has given Kadyrov carte blanche to run Chechnya as his own personal fiefdom, provided he keeps the separatist forces which temporarily ripped the republic from the Kremlin's grasp in the 1990s are kept in check. Aside from Yamadayev a string of other Kadryov opponents have wound up dead in locations stretching from Moscow to Istanbul and Vienna, though the man himself has always denied involvement in any of their killings. Kadyrov hugs a man in a bear suit in front of the neon backdrop of the Chechen capital Grozny's skyline . The former warlord posted this viral video of a panda rolling down a snow covered hill on his Instagram page . This short film of pandas on a slide at the Chengdu Panda Base in China was another posted by Kadyrov . The video has more than 9million times on Youtube, and likely picked up some of those thanks to Kadyrov . Russian investigative journalist Anna Politkovskaya was shot dead in the capital in October 2006 while she was reportedly working on a story about torture and human rights abuses in Chechnya. Some observers laid the blame for the killing at Kadyrov's door. A month later Movladi Baisarov, a former commander of the Chechen presidential security services turned Kadyrov opponent, was also shot dead in Moscow. He had branded Kadyrov 'a medieval tyrant', adding: 'If someone tells the truth about what is going on, it's like signing one's own death warrant. 'Ramzan is a law unto himself. He can do anything he likes. He can take any woman and do whatever he pleases with her. 'Ramzan acts with total impunity. I know of many people executed on his express orders and I know exactly where they were buried.' And\u00a0In a remarkable statement posted on Instagram, Kadyrov praised one of the men charged with the murder of Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov in Moscow as a 'fearless and brave' 'patriot of Russia' who was 'ready to give his life for the Motherland'.",

Many Zoolander fans were overjoyed when the pair stepped out to close the Valentino runway show earlier this month, in the guise of their iconic characters Derek Zoolander and Hansel. But now the comedic duo have taken the unlikely collaboration off the runway in order to pose up for a quirky print campaign, which is believed to have been shot around the same time as the catwalk show.

Not content with crashing Valentino's Paris Fashion Week show, now models of the moment Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson have taken over the fashion house's latest campaign shoots. And we just can't get enough. The other creative duo, Valentino designers, Maria Grazia Chiuri and Pier Paolo Piccioli, have really breathed new life into the iconic brand and we've been swooning over their collections for the last few seasons. We've fallen head over heels for their ethereal gowns and been floored by their rainbow bright stripes this season. And one of our favorite prints from the fashion house is this red and white rendered one. Just a few days we spotted Amanda Seyfried wearing a very similar pussy bow style from the Pre-Fall 2015 line for her stint on the red carpet at the While We're Young premiere in New York.

The high-end fashion brand, which is usually known for its beautiful gowns and must-have accessories,  released the pictures from the stars' shoot earlier this week - prompting speculation that the label's designs will actually be featured in the upcoming Zoolander 2 movie. 'Does this mean that Valentino are going to be making the Zoolander 2 clothes? (sic)' on person tweeted, while another added: 'Zoolander and Valentino are the dream team.' But despite the immense popularity of the first Zoolander movie, which was released back in 2001, Ben admitted that he was shocked to see how excited fans were after the pair made their appearance on the Valentino runway. 'I was a little surprised,' the 49-year-old  said about the reaction. 'I mean it's been 15 years since the movie came out so we really didn't know if people remembered or cared, and it was nice to know that there was a little bit of a connection there that people had.' Strike a pose: Ben and Owen have been in Paris for a couple of weeks to promote the sequel to their 2001 comedy Zoolander . Indeed, Ben and Owen's commitment to ensuring they made their Zoolander 2 debut with a bang was admirable. Not only did the pair manage to take some of the spotlight away from a couture fashion house (with its permission, of course) they also did it during one of the world's most respected fashion-focused events, while still earning a round of applause from the fashion community. Ben added however, that he was 'just happy we were able to keep it a surprise and nobody tripped'. 'We thought it would be a fun idea as a way to announce the movie,' he further explained, when asked why they chose Paris Fashion Week to make the announcement. 'We sort of had top three designers or brands that we went to and TJ\u00a0Maxx and Burlington Coat Factory bowed out at the last minute so we went Valentino.' On the catwalk: Ben, and Owen wore specially-designed creations for Valentino's fall/winter 2015/2016 show (pictured) Repeat performance: Derek Zoolander's (left) world was turned upside down when Hansel (right) won the model of the year award in the previous movie (pictured) Ben famously wrote and directed the 2001 movie, which detailed the life of the dimwitted male model Derek Zoolander. The original movie  poked fun at the fashion world and the duo managed to raise the roof when they stepped back into their comic roles at the end of Valentino's real-life autumn-winter women's collection. Ben even recreated the trademark Blue Steel surprised duck-face look of his  Zoolander character for the chuckling photographers gathered at the venue in the gardens in front of the Louvre museum and Eiffel Tower.

The former Chelsea midfielder was thrown on in the 87th minute by manager Manuel Pellegrini, in what is likely to be his last ever Champions League game, as City were dumped out by Barcelona after a 3-1 aggregate defeat in the last 16. It was Lampard's 52nd match in the latter stages of Europe's top club competition moving him one clear of a group of four players. Frank Lampard came on as a late sub on Wednesday to make 52nd Champions League knockout appearance . Lampard is unlikely to add to his tally as he prepares to join New York City in the summer .

Iker Casillas could also overtake the former England international following completion of the last-eight tie . Real Madrid pair Cristiano Ronaldo and Iker Casillas, Barcelona midfiedler Xavi and Manchester United goalkeeper Victor Valdes are all tied on 51 appearances in the knockout stage. Lampard, who won the competition with Chelsea in 2012, is only likely to hold the record for less than one month with Ronaldo, Casillas and Xavi, to a lesser extent, set to feature for their sides in next month's quarter-finals. Former England international Lampard will join New York City in the summer and, barring an unlikely return to Europe, will not get the chance to add to his tally of Champions League knockout games. John Terry and Andres Iniesta are the only other two players in the top 10 that are still playing, while Lionel Messi just misses out on the list. The Barcelona forward is on 45 appearances, however, and is almost certain to make his way towards the top in the coming seasons.

        "document": "The City of Light is often captured in all its beauty with a series of images that show off its romantic side. But an American filmmaker has created a three-minute video that presents Paris in an entirely unique way. Sean Collins, a 31-year-old from Los Angeles, used special effects to make the French capital's famous landmarks, including the Eiffel Tour and Arc de Triomphe, and pedestrians look like miniature toys. The video is the work of photographer Sean Collins, who studied at the American School of Paris . The American video maker captures a shot of the Eiffel Tower in the distance of his unique film . Sean filmed the scenes over the course of eight days while visiting his girlfriend, a Boston University student who is studying in Paris. He said: \u2018When I went to visit her we decided to make this video. On her days off she accompanied me to the sites to film. \u2018We couldn't film on rainy, cloudy or days with poor air quality and we had to go to each location multiple times.\u2019 Sean, who was educated at The American School of Paris, but later studied at a film school in California, explained that his intention was to present the French capital in a way it has never been seen before. Sean Collins experimented with effects that make Paris famous landmarks look like small toy sets . The people captured underneath the Eiffel Tower in a timelapse shot appear to look like figurines . He said: \u2018My goal was to show Paris to the world in a new light for those who have never had the experience or never managed to make it those sites.\u2019 The video opens on a landscape shot of the city, with the Eiffel Tower and Army Museum appearing to be positioned almost too close together. The Champ de Mars is presented in beautiful saturated green colours with people walking around it, appearing to look like figurines. Sean spent two weeks testing different ways to change the texture of the different images . A train is captured in the film and appears to look like a toy being controlled by a child . Shots of boats travelling under bridges tie Paris' natural beauty with its urban iconography . A couple of timelapse shots of the Eiffel Tower continue this theme before a train, which looks like it could be being controlled by a child, travels across a bridge. More landscape shots show a breakdancer looking like a puppet on a string and a group playing football. As darkness descends on the Parisian streets the landscapes become more beautiful, before daylight is reinstated and the traffic begins to swell. Sean recorded the video over eight days with the help of his girlfriend who he was visiting in Paris . The Arc de Triomphe is momentarily captured before more close-ups shots of people looking like toys . A distant shot of the Arc de Triomphe is momentarily captured before more close-ups of people negotiating busy streets. Eventually the video concludes with footage of pigeons, a boat travelling under a bridge \u2013 which ties Paris\u2019 beauty as a natural landscape and an urban city together \u2013 and a casual shot of the Eiffel Tower. Discussing the difficulties faced while filming, Sean explained that the final result is the product of much experimentation. Sean's goal was to show Paris in a new light for those who have never had the chance to experience it . Sean had to prepare for each shot and was unable to film on rainy or cloudy days or days with poor air quality . \u2018It's not as simple as just adding blur to the top and bottom to achieve the effect. I spent two weeks testing different ways to change the \"texture\" of the image,\u2019 he said. \u2018I experimented with some really distorted toy-like effects but eventually settled on this more subtle effect. This was a combination of noise reduction and sharpening.\u2019 Sean\u2019s work is available on his Facebook page and the original video can be viewed here.",

        "document": "When you first enter your hotel room, it's tempting to immediately head toward the minibar, brew yourself a cup of coffee or raid the toiletries that have been supplied for you. But, before you get carried away, there are a few things that you should know. Your stately room is likely not as clean as you believe it to be. And those goodies you're eager to try out? They may not actually be free. MailOnline Travel reveals the most important things to know about your hotel room, including those that no one will ever tell you... Hotel rooms may appear clean, but there are certain areas the cleaning staff don't often have time to inspect . Beware when touching the television remotes and light switches . A study\u00a0by the University of Houston revealed that the most touched places in the room such as television remotes and bedside lamp switches are often the least cleaned. Results found that in some cases, they had as much bacteria as bathroom toilet seats and sinks. That's enough for us to remember to pack our hand santizer whenever we travel! Pack your sanitizer for items like remotes and light switches which are hot spots for germs . Drinking from the bathroom glasses . You may be tempted to quench your thirst when you arrive and use the bathroom glasses for a drink. However in an\u00a0expose\u00a0by Fox News, it was revealed that many hotel maids do not wash them out with soap before the next guest checks in. Hidden cameras revealed glasses that were rinsed only with water, or that were wiped down with a cloth that had previously been used for cleaning the room. Use bottled water, or request plastic cups from reception to be safe. Think before you snuggle up in the blankets . Due to a lack of seating area in some hotels, the bed becomes the place where most people sit, eat, and perform other, ahem, intimate activities. Some mothers even change their child's nappies on the blankets, too. While you have no need to worry about items that get washed daily, some of the smaller blankets may not get replaced that often. It is advisable to check user comments before staying at a hotel so that you are aware of the experiences of other guests. Don't assume that everything is free . Everyone loves to stock up on the hotel-provided shampoo, shower cap and biscuits, but guests should never assume that everything is up for grabs. While pens and brochures are often free to use and take, items such as bathrobes, slippers may not be. Travelodge have noted a number of items being taken out their rooms that are supposed to remain. Shakila Ahmed, Travelodge spokeswoman said: 'Since we have introduced our new brand design and modernised our rooms, we have seen a significant rise in our fluffy pillows, snuggly duvets, striped bed runners and contemporary artwork being taken from our 500 UK hotels. 'There have even been attempts to smuggle our new luxurious king size Travelodge Dreamer bed out of the hotels.' Don't threaten to leave a bad TripAdvisor review in change for perks . Unfortunately, some people resort to blackmail to receive\u00a0upgrades\u00a0and free perks, in exchange for not writing a negative comment on the hotel's TripAdvisor page. If you are tempted to use this technique, take note: hotels have a way of\u00a0proactively reporting any threats before a corresponding review is submitted. A spokesperson for the online review site said: 'It is absolutely against the terms and spirit of our site to use TripAdvisor's name to try and claim discounts or freebies that would not be available to other guests. 'Our fraud detection experts will then investigate and, where we find evidence of threatening behaviour, take action to stop their reviews from ever reaching the site.' The mini bar items are extremely over-priced for what you get, bring your own snacks for guilt-free feasting . Keep your name and room number private . Telling other guests your full name and room number can lead to unwanted visitors and charges finding their way to your room. Set your own wake up call . On occasion, the front desk will forget to call you for your 3am flight reminder. Eliminate the risk and set your phone alarm yourself. Take hand santizer . Even if the room passed the cleaning inspection, there are still corners that the staff may not have reached. Keep yourself protected and always carry a bottle on trips. Request the top floor or a corner room . The top floor rooms tend to have higher ceilings, better views and less noise than other rooms. Corner rooms also tend to be larger - regardless of the floor its on. Tip generously . Leaving a little something for the staff gives a great impression and shows that you're grateful for their service. Plus, it doesn't hurt for them to remember your generosity when you have a request during your stay. Don't go crazy with the minibar . When you're nice and cosy, it can be tempting to see what the minibar has to offer, as opposed to leaving the room to explore other snacking options. However, prices of items in the fridges are often exorbitant, and can leave you regretting that last little packet of peanuts when you get the bill. Before indulging, remember this: The 2014\u00a0TripIndex Survey\u00a0found that average price for nuts in Switzerland, France, New York, Canada, Singapore and Sweden was over $10. Topping the leader board was Toronto, where the average bag of nuts cost an unbelievable $18.23. And don't add your own items . For savvy travellers who bring their own items instead of perusing the (expensive) minibar options, beware. You could still be hit with a large charge. Several hotels have a restocking fee to dissuade you from placing personal items in the fridge. Last year it was revealed that hidden fees were set to earn hotels \u00a31.4bn in revenue add-ons, a six per cent increase from 2013. A study by  a professor at New York University's hospitality school noted that although these fees only add an extra two per cent in revenue, most of that money is pure profit for the hotel. Blogger Keri Anderson was horrified to find that there was a charge to placing personal items in the fridge . Be careful when using the coffee machine . An investigation by ABC News showed cleaners simply swirling the pots in water without properly cleaning them, which leads to a build up of bacteria. In Cincinnati, Ohio, one cleaner was found to have cleaned the pot with a bottle of Lysol mildew remover, and another was captured using the same cloth to clean the coffee maker as she had used to clean the bathroom floor. Always clean the machine yourself before use - even if it had been cleaned after the last user, it could have been sitting around collecting dust for a few weeks before you arrive.",

King Felipe and Queen Letizia of Spain arrive at the ceremony welcoming the Colombian president to Spain . Queen Letizia of Spain (right) and Colombian president's wife Maria Clemencia Rodriguez (left) followed their husbands during the official ceremony welcoming the South American leaders to Madrid . The mother-of-two teamed a nude blouse with a nude and black patterned pencil skirt and patent nude heels. Her coat was an elegant tailored wool affair and she held a discreet black leather clutch. As usual, the Spanish royal opted for small pearl drop earrings, while her hair was worn in a simple side parting. Her South American counterpart, Maria Clemencia Rodriguez went for a grey dress with matching pearl-studded biker-style jacket. Queen Letizia and husband Felipe welcomed their Colombian counterparts on a three-day visit to Spain . From left to right, Queen Letizia of Spain, Juan Manuel Santos, the president of Colombia, King Felipe VI of Spain and Maria Clemencia Rodriguez, the first lady of Colombia on the steps of La Zarzuela palace . The women walked behind their husbands and seemed to have plenty to talk during the stately event which was then followed by an official luncheon at La Zarzuela Palace. The foursome reviewed the troops and listened to their national anthems to kick off Santos's three-day long visit to Spain. No doubt Letizia, a former top newspaper and TV journalist had much to discuss with Santos, who is the former deputy director of El Tiempo, the main Colombian newspaper. Just last week, art-lover Letizia and her husband attended the 34th ARCO International Contemporary Art Fair at the IFEMA exhibition site in the Spanish capital, which will feature Colombian artists this year.

She's a royal who's garnered a firm fashion following and with outfits like this, it's easy to see why Queen Letizia's style goes down such a storm. We love the way she's introduced a slight edginess to her look thanks to the studded dress which puts a fresh spin on the otherwise classic colour block design. Her chic frock is by one of her favourite designers, Felipe Varela, who's designs she often turns to for public appearances. That said, we love the fact she also champions the Spanish high-street by regularly wearing brands like Zara, Uterque and Mango. Love Letizia's dress too?

At the event, which will run until 1 March, Letizia gazed at one piece made up of a vast canvas covered in red paint, nailed to the wall, which appeared to drip into a red pool on the floor where lay clustered a paint roller, pots and brushes.

The pair also attended the Picasso Museum in Malaga on Spain's Costa del Sol, in September, before attending a formal dinner . Earlier this week Letizia attended a meeting with the board of the Royal Council on Disability.

        "document": "France is filled with foreboding about the fate that awaits Philippe Saint-Andre's misfiring team at Twickenham. The coach has come in for fierce criticism during another RBS Six Nations campaign of grinding, mid-table mediocrity, but according to two members of the last Gallic team to win a championship match in London, exactly a decade ago, the problems run deeper than the man in charge. Their primary concerns are the mass influx of overseas players into the Top 14 league which has stalled the development of home-grown talent \u2013 and the death of French flair. France full back Scott Spedding (left), who was born in South Africa, makes a break against Italy in Rome . Racing Metro flanker Bernard le Roux (centre) is another South African-born player in France's ranks . Clermont winger Noa Nakaitaci (right) was born in Fiji but now represents Les Bleus . Rory Kockott was snapped up by France after the South African scrum half qualified on residency grounds . France coach\u00a0Philippe Saint-Andre has come in for strong criticism following another mediocre campaign . VIDEO Italy v France - extended highlights . 72 per cent: English players in Premiership match day squads so far this season. 70 per cent: English players in 2014 Aviva Premiership final match day squads. 71 per cent: English players in Premiership sides for last round of Champions Cup. 45 per cent: French players in Top 14 squads, according to French study. 46 per cent: French players in 2014 Top 14 final match day squads. 62 per cent: French players in Top 14 sides for last round of Champions Cup. There is still a mathematical chance that Les Bleus can win the title this weekend, but that is pie in the sky and cannot disguise their chronic limitations. Dimitri Yachvili, the goal-kicking hero of France's 18-17 win at the home of their fiercest rivals in 2005, describes it as a 'bad time for our rugby' and suggests that the booming import trade is the primary issue. 'To me, the problem is that we have too many foreign players in the Top 14 and all the good young French players don't play enough,' said the former Biarritz scrum-half. 'The clubs prefer buying a South African player, or a Kiwi player or an Australian player \u2013 maybe because they think it is safer to do that. The young players don't play and that is not good. 'When young players arrive in the French team, they don't have enough experience of the high level. A few years ago, you had to be good for one or two years for your club, before you could be picked for France. Now you just have to do one good move in a match. Former France scrum half Dimitri Yachvili fires out a pass during his side's clash against England in 2004 . Yachvili's sublime goal-kicking performance secured France's last victory at Twickenham back in 2005 . 'Against Wales at Stade de France and against Ireland in Dublin, we were not very far from winning those games, but we are missing the experience that is needed. If we didn't have so many foreign players in our league, the players would have more experience and we could win those games.' Serge Betsen was another stalwart of the France team that stormed the Twickenham barricades 10 years ago. The ex-Biarritz and Wasps flanker is also worried about the lack of player development in his country, adding: 'The politicians need to help the youngsters to get experience at the highest level. English rugby organises things to give their national players priority. 'During my time at Biarritz, I played with Joe Roff, who won the World Cup with Australia. These kind of players showed me how to improve. To be in contact with them is important, but you still need to give opportunities to the youngsters. We've got a lot of talented players like Gael Fickou and Wesley Fofana. But Fickou needs the time to express his talent. I don't know why he hasn't had the time.' Former France flanker Serge Betsen (right) is worried by the amount of overseas players in the Top 14 . Noa Nakaitaci . Once captain of the Fiji schoolboys team, the powerful winger moved to France after Clermont Auvergne set up an academy in the Pacific Islands. He signed with the Top 14 club in 2011 and made his France debut two years later. Rory Kockott . The scrum-half was snapped up by Les Bleus as soon as he became eligible for selection through the three-year residency rule. He was tipped as a Springboks star following his time with the Natal Sharks but was overlooked by South Africa coach Heyneke Meyer. Bernard Le Roux . Despite being born and raised in Moorreesburg, South Africa, the flanker made his rugby debut in Amsterdam. He joined the Border Bulldogs on the Eastern Cape and was offered a deal with the Lions but opted for a move to Racing Metro. Scott Spedding . Born in Krugersdorp, South Africa, the full back came through the Natal Sharks academy and represented the Springboks at Under 21 level. He signed for Brive in 2008 before moving to Bayonne and was granted a French passport last year. The decline of the renowned French flair has been in evidence at Test and club level for several years now. A nation once known for cavalier attacking play which conjured such iconic moments as the fabled 'Try from the end of the earth' in Auckland in 1994 has largely adopted a more pragmatic, Anglo-Saxon reliance on brute force. Asked if his country have tried too hard to play like England, Yachvili said: 'Yes, yes. We have lost our French rugby a little bit, because a lot of foreign players have come to play for the French clubs and they have another culture and another way of playing. We must try to keep the French flair, but I think we have lost that a bit. 'It is in our DNA to play intuitive rugby. We don't have the best organisation and the best game-plans in the world, but what we have more than other nations is this way to attack from everywhere. But we must be open-minded and free to play this rugby, and at the moment I think we're not free.' Betsen echoed his former team-mate, adding: 'England has taken parts of the French to add that X-factor to their game \u2013 guys like George Ford \u2013 who aren't just about kicking but can spot the gap. 'French rugby tried to follow other nations and copy their way of doing things, but it's not always been effective. We want players to practise weights more than passing, but we need a more holistic approach. The flair comes with confidence and trust. You need panache, enjoyment and excitement; sometimes that's been missing.' What has not been lost along the way is a fervent passion for this classic fixture. The cross-Channel rivalry stirs French blood as much as it ever did. An admiration for those who wear the Red Rose is temporarily shelved at kick-off time. 'We like English rugby, but we hate them just for 80 minutes!' said Yachvili, who spent a season at Gloucester. 'They are very good players, they are very well organised, they have a very good game-plan and we respect them, but for 80 minutes it will always be a very big battle. Betsen believes players such as Gael Fickou (left) and Wesley Fofana are hindered by the current system . 'Of course, it is the biggest game for us. It is historic and it is always special. It is Le Crunch. It is the last game this year and England can still win the Six Nations. For us, we will be more scared before the game than last week or against Wales at home, but I'm hoping we can do something special.' That is certainly what Yachvili did in 2005. It was his special goal-kicking that helped France rally from a 17-6 half-time deficit to win 18-17. As it turns out, he was assisted with his match-winning efforts by an Englishman, whose identity remains a secret. 'It was crazy because, in the captain's run training session the day before the game, my kicking was very bad and my coach was very scared about the game,' he said. 'But in the game, I think one kick hit the post but the rest were good. Giant New Zealand-born prop\u00a0Uini Atonio (right) is another foreign player that is part of the France squad . 'I broke my kicking tee in the captain's run training session and I had to ask a friend living in London where I could buy a tee, because I wanted the same one. He said the only shop around was at Twickenham, so he went to buy my tee for the game there, but nobody knew it! I will not tell you the name of the friend, but he is English!' France surely won't be short of a tee or two this time, but better preparation may not be enough to end their long wait for a championship win in the English capital. But Yachvili hasn't abandoned all hope. 'When people think we are no good, that is when France do something,' he said \u2013 ominously for the home side. 'On paper, we would say England will beat us easily, because their rugby is more efficient and much better than us right now. But with French rugby, we never know.'",

        "document": "Clarke Carlisle pictured outside of court on Monday . Clarke Carlisle has pleaded guilty to a drink-driving offence that occurred two days before the former footballer tried to kill himself by jumping in front of a lorry. The 35-year-old, still bearing the facial scars from his December 22 suicide attempt in a crash which left him in a coma until mid-January, spoke clearly as he stood in the dock at Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court in north London. The former Professional Footballers' Association chairman, who played for Leeds United, Burnley and Queens Park Rangers, admitted failing to provide a sample on December 20. He also pleaded guilty to a charge of driving otherwise than in accordance with a licence on the same date, when police officers spotted a Mercedes travelling in an 'erratic' manner, prosecutor Zahid Hussain said. Deputy District Judge Margaret Dodds told Carlisle that he would 'inevitably' be disqualified when he next appears at the same court for sentencing on May 14. She also ordered that reports be made in the case after being told of Carlisle's medical situation. He had been spotted by police 'swerving' his Mercedes and nearly hitting a lorry on Pentonville Road, north London, on December 20 at about 7am. Mr Hussain said the car was seen 'swerving in the lane, to the pavement on the nearside, almost mounting the pavement' and that the tyres were 'grinding on the curb'. When the officers stopped and spoke to Carlisle, 'alcohol was smelled on his breath', Mr Hussain added. Carlisle discussed his failed suicide attempt in February with Absolute Radio's Jon Champion in what was his first radio appearance since leaving hospital. He said he was 'disgusted' with himself and told family members he 'did not want to be here' when they visited him in Leeds General Infirmary. 'I was only in LGI for three days and throughout those three days my family were coming to see me,' he said. 'Every time I came and felt unconditional love. It was just another point of self loathing. I was disgusted with myself and I said I have to be honest with you 'I still do not want to be here'. Former Leeds United footballer Carlisle has pleaded guilty to a drink-driving offence on December 20 . It happened two days before he tried to kill himself in a crash on December 22 with his scar still visible . Born: Preston, October 14, 1979 (age 35) Playing position: Defender . 1997-2000: Blackpool (93 lg apps, 7 goals) 2000-2004: QPR (96, 6) 2004-2005: Leeds United (35, 4) 2005-2007: Watford (36, 3) 2007-2007: Luton Town (loan) (5, 0) 2007-2012: Burnley (131, 7) 2011-2012: Preston (loan) (20, 3) 2012-2012: Northampton Town (loan) (18, 1) 2012-2013: York City (10, 0) 2012-2013: Northampton Town (loan) (5, 0) 2013-2013: Northampton Town (21, 3) 'And that disgusted me even more. Because these are the people who are coming to love me and care for me. And I'm telling them that in spite of that I want to be dead.' Carlisle revealed he would have been sectioned if he rejected the chance of attending a psychiatric hospital. The lorry driver who struck Carlisle said he may never be able to get behind the wheel again. Darren Pease feared both he and Carlisle would die after glass shattered following the crash, leaving them with cuts to their faces and the driver temporarily blinded. He told the Daily Mirror:\u00a0'That feeling is indescribable - to think you are going to die. 'I don't think I'll ever be able to get behind the wheel of a lorry again. I can't see any way back for me at this point. I can't drive a car properly, never mind a wagon. 'All I could think was that I had killed someone. How am I going to live with this? What am I going to tell everybody? 'What do you say? It's unreal, the shock meant I couldn't stand or walk, I was in a wheelchair.' Carlisle spoke clearly as he stood in the dock at Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court in north London .",

        "document": "If you find your hour in the gym leaves you exhausted, spare a thought for four determined British women about to embark on an epic adventure that will test them to their limits. The women are attempting to be the first female 4's team to row unsupported across the Pacific Ocean from America to Australia. Throughout the 8,446-mile journey, the women will have to spend  two hours on the oars and two hours off for six months solid. Scroll down for video . The women (front to back, Laura, Natalia and Emma) will be alone on the vast ocean for six months of mentally and physical activity . Laura, Isabel, Natalia and Emma on their rowing machines.\u00a0'The main muscle groups we train by doing dead lifts, bench press, leg press, seated row, single arm row and core strengthening,' explains Natalia . The women are attempting to be the first female 4's team to row unsupported across the Pacific Ocean from America to Australia, which will involve spending two hours on the oars and two hours off for six months . Apart from issues like sleep deprivation, adverse weather conditions, injury, salt sores, sun exposure and potential equipment malfunction, the\u00a0coxless crew also need to train themselves to deal with psychological challenges of  monotony, confined living quarters and limited contact with the outside world. That's on top of the fitness and strength training needed to take on the momentous rowing feat. Yet, the formidable foursome set to  embark on this exceptional journey - in a 29ft long and 7ft wide pink boat called Doris - describe themselves as 'ordinary'. Laura Penhaul, 31, from Cornwall, is a physiotherapist for the Paralympics and is the team leader; Natalia Cohen, 40, from Manchester is a travel operations manager and has spent two decades living in countries in the developing world; Isabel Burnham, 30, from Cambridge works as a solicitor and Emma Mitchell, 29, from Marlow is an expedition manager for a travel company. The\u00a0coxless crew, who\u00a0are aiming to raise over a quarter of a million pounds for two charities: Walking With the Wounded and Breast Cancer Care survivors, have just over two weeks to go before they embark upon their voyage. Taking on the challenge of a lifetime: Isabel Burnham,  Laura Penhaul, Emma Mitchell and Natalia Cohen will row the Pacific in a 29ft long and 7ft wide pink boat called Doris . Laura said: 'We say that this row is 85 per cent psychological in how we cope and 15 per cent physical, but our psychological state will be affected by being dehydrated, calorie deficient, sleep deprived and hormone imbalanced. So if we can optimise these variables then it will will help our mental state.' Natalia added: 'Our mental strength is going to be vital. I believe that we all have our own Pacific to cross, in whatever form that comes. 'We want to empower others to have faith  and dig deep to fight and overcome whatever adversity life throws your way. I believe you can do anything you set your mind to.' So how are the brave four ensuring they are in peak mental and physical health? We look at their intense preparation for the dangerous journey of a lifetime. The team (left to right) Isabel, Emma, Natalia and Laura on board their pink boat, Doris, where they will be spending six months as they row\u00a08,446 miles . Emma and Laura in action on board Doris:\u00a0The four formidable women about to embark on this exceptional journey, describe themselves as 'ordinary' PILING ON POUNDS AND MUSCLE . Natalia said: 'Our physical training  involves weight sessions to increase our lean muscle mass and strengthen certain key areas of the body to help prevent injury. 'The main muscle groups we train by doing dead lifts, bench press, leg press, seated row, single arm row and core strengthening.' The women are also channeling their efforts into gaining weight. They need to increase their body weight by ten to 15 per cent in lean muscle and fat for reserve energy stores. That\u2019s between seven to ten kilos each. The cabin where the team will spend most of their time is  the size of a small-to-medium two-man tent . 'It's not quite as fun as it sounds,' she added. 'Drinking wine and eating lots of cakes and chocolates is unfortunately not the answer to this challenge. 'The weight has to go on in a controlled way, alongside a tailor-made exercise and weight training regime. 'We need lots of protein shakes along with high volumes of red meat, chicken, fish, eggs and nuts, while still  maintaining balance with fruit and vegetables - not to mention the massive intakes of carbohydrates required to power us through the physical work. SAYING GOODBYE TO SLEEP . During the row the women will enter a polyphasic sleep pattern by taking short frequent naps as opposed to the normal monophasic pattern, which is a seven or eight hour block. 'We've done a 48-hour row where we practiced the two-hour on and two-hour off sleep pattern we will be rowing out on the ocean,' says Natalia. 'As long as we can manage to get one full sleep cycle (on average between 45 to 90 minutes) into each shift, we believe the body will have enough time to rest, repair and allow hormonal release as necessary.' And are they testing their exhaustion limits by limiting sleep before the big adventure? 'There's no point,' Natalia said. 'We know we'll be sleep deprived for six months. There's no benefit of being sleep deprived for longer.' The coxless crew (left to right):\u00a0Isabel Burnham, 30,\u00a0Emma Mitchell, 29,\u00a0Laura Penhaul, 31 and\u00a0Natalia Cohen, 40 all have day jobs and describe themselves as 'ordinary' DEALING WITH STRESS . 'It\u2019s all about recognising what stress feels like for each of us,' Natalia explained. 'What happens to our bodies on a physical and emotional level and how do we behave? 'We will each react differently and while some may be more open, for some of the team we have had to learn how to read each other\u2019s body language to know how they are feeling if they are not vocal about it.' In order to be attuned to each other's behaviours, the women look out for what type of faces they might be pulling, whether they are fidgeting or if there's there something unusual about their behaviour. 'We have practiced coping strategies that draw on  breathing techniques, imagery, music or mantras and mental scripts to help us deal with the stressful situation the most efficiently,' Natalia said. BONDING AS A TEAM . The women didn\u2019t know each other before and have united solely for the purpose of this expedition. 'Through exercises given to us by our sports psychologist Keith Goddard, we have learnt to understand each other\u2019s personality types and why we work in a certain way,' she said. 'We have developed a great team dynamic where we play to each other\u2019s strengths and support development with any weaknesses. 'We do reflections and feedback sessions regularly after an event, so that we can check that we are happy with how everyone is performing and working and that when we receive constructive feedback we don\u2019t take it personally. 'It\u2019s all about learning from situations, ensuring that we continually develop, being effective and having trust in each other and the strength of the team. Natalia Cohen, one of the Coxless Four team at GSK's Human Performance Lab, where the team simulated part of their expedition to assess how many litres is optimal for each of them to drink . The Coxless Four team rowers, Isabel Burnham (far left) and Emma Mitchell (second left) with team-mates Natalia Cohen and Laura Penhaul (top and bottom on rowing machines) STAYING POSITIVE . 'Our minds are the most powerful tool we have to tap into and again and we will need to draw upon our coping strategies and techniques to keep us upbeat and in the moment,' says Natalia. The key, she explains, is to break everything down into manageable sized chunks. 'When we start rowing, we will need to take it stroke by stroke,' she says of getting back on the oars after a two-hour sleep. 'We will undoubtedly have days that are harder than others and I think when one person is having a really bad day, some else may be having an OK one.' KEEPING FOCUSED . Staying focused is a major challenge for the team. 'The second we spot land when coming into Hawaii can be celebrated for a moment but that does not mean that we have arrived,' Natalia said. There could still  challenging days still ahead before they pull into the harbour and the danger of relaxing, is that the team loses focus. 'The way we can overcome this is by ensuring that mentally our end point of each leg is something way beyond just seeing land for the first time. 'We need to project much further than that and have something like the water hitting our face from a shower in our accommodation to signify the end point of each leg. 'That way our focus remains strong and constant through the last few days, the arriving into port, clearing and cleaning Doris and then finally heading to the accommodation for a shower! Only then can we relax and know that we have safely arrived.' The coxless crew ,  are aiming to raise over a quarter of a million pounds for two charities: Walking With the Wounded and Breast Cancer Care survivors . Left to right: Natalia, Isabel, Emma and Laura look forward to reaching labd - but won't allow themselves to get excited until they're in the shower . TAKING THE HEAT . The team had physiological testing with GSK Human Performance Lab to simulate part of their expedition. The women will be rowing across the equator in extreme temperatures  during the six-month odyssey. 'We had salt and lactate testing done while rowing in a temperature controlled chamber in 40 degree heat and 40 per cent humidity so that we know how many litres it is optimal for each of us to drink and how much salt we lose through sweating,'  Natalia said. The team will share the highs and lows of their arduous and epic expedition via a live tracker on their\u00a0Coxless Crew website\u00a0and on their Facebook and Twitter pages.

And Bale said: \u2018I don\u2019t need to answer the critics. I know, and everyone around me knows, what I can do. \u2018There are ups and downs in football, you have to take it with a pinch of salt and all you can do is respond with your performances on the pitch, like that. \u2018I don\u2019t feel I need to prove anyone wrong or right, I just need to play my football. Bale was heavily criticised after Real Madrid's 2-1 defeat at the hands of La Liga rivals Barcelona . Bale's car was attacked by angry Real Madrid fans following the defeat by Barcelona last Sunday .

        "document": "The Prince of Wales and Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, ended their second day in the U.S. with a glitzy night out with friends in Washington D.C. The couple, who will celebrate their 10th anniversary next month, put on their best dress for a dinner hosted by Barby Allbritton, the head of the prince's charity in the U.S. and the widow of Joe Allbritton, who owned news stations and the website Politico. The Allbrittons were so close to the British royals that they were two of a few Americans invited to the Royal Wedding between Charles' son Prince William and Kate Middleton in 2011. Charles and Camilla joined Mrs Allbritton, her son Robert - who now runs Politico - and his wife Elena for the black tie charity affair on Wednesday night. The event was so secretive that other guests were only given the address earlier in the day,\u00a0PageSix reported. Prince Charles and Camila, Duchess of Cornwall, smile outside the a private home on Wednesday where they had dinner.

She is the wife of the late media magnate Joe Allbritton, who owned news stations and the website Politico . The night out came in the middle of the royal couple's four-day trip to the U.S., which is largely being spent in Washington D.C. before a trip to Louisville, Kentucky on Friday. Charles and Camilla still look bright-eyed as they arrived at the party despite a whirlwind day  visiting D.C.'s landmarks and George Washington's plantation before delving into environmental policy. At a meeting of the Global Ocean Commission and the International Sustainability Unit - a charitable group established by the prince to address environmental concerns - Charles spoke about the dangers of accumulating plastic waste in the world's oceans. 'Although the evidence surrounding the links between plastic waste and human health are not yet clear, I would tentatively suggest that they are unlikely to be beneficial,'he said during his 10-minute speech at the Hay Adams hotel. Charles said that he was \u2018haunted\u2019 and \u2018horrified\u2019 by the issue which needed to be solved for the sake of future generations. Passionate: Following a day of sight-seeing on Wednesday, Prince Charles also attended an environmental event at the Hay Adams hotel, where he gave a 10-minute speech on the importance of recycling . Meeting the King: Charles and Camilla arrive at the Martin Luther King Memorial in Washington DC, where they were met by\u00a0Congresswoman Terri Sewel, left, and civil rights leader Jesse Jackson, right . Making friends: The royal couple drew a crowd as they arrived at the Memorial on Tuesday . Fans: Members of the public, including a middle school history class, snap photos of the royal couple . \u2018Speaking as a grandfather with a new grandchild due to appear in this world in a month\u2019s time, I think we probably owe it to everyone else\u2019s grandchildren to grasp that solution,\u2019 he said. His impassioned speech came after he and his wife took time out to play tourists. On Wednesday morning, the couple wrapped up against the brisk temperatures for their 20-minute tour of the Martin Luther King memorial and paused to read his quotations engraved in the stone. 'Darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that,' read one quotation where the royal couple paused to see King's words from 1963. Harry Johnson, the president of the foundation that built the King memorial, said he gave the royal couple a stone from the memorial's granite as a gift. The couple then visited the Lincoln Memorial, where they were greeted by historians. Towering: The royals posed in front of the memorials with members of congress and civil rights leaders . Paying their respects: Charles and Camilla speak with Ed Jackson during their tour of the memorial . Taking the tour: Camilla, who was chic in a grey coat, was shown around by Congresswoman Terri Sewel . During the visit, they were happy to chat with students on field trips. Joan Darby, who brought her U.S. history class from Stafford, Virginia, to the King memorial said they were thrilled to meet Charles and Camilla, along with civil rights leaders Rev. Jesse Jackson and Rep. John Lewis. 'To come here and have such a joyful event was just really incredible luck on our part,' she said. Camilla, who was showing off a chic new hairstyle, obligingly stopped for a selfie before continuing on with U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell by her side. Charles and Camilla were then whisked off to Mount Vernon, where they were met by the Governor and First Lady of Virginia, Terry and Dorothy McAuliffe. One of the most historic spots in the US, parts of the estate have been in the Washington family since the mid-17th century and it was at Mount Vernon that George Washington, the first president of the United States, lived. Spectacular: The white marble monument is arguably the most famous in Washington D.C . Spotted: The royal couple were spotted by a party of American schoolchildren and swiftly surrounded . Pleased: Prince Charles appeared delighted to see so many well-wishers outside the Memorial . Obliging: Camilla even agreed to join one excited teenager for a royal selfie before moving to the next stop . Excited: News of the royal visit brought a crowd of excited well-wishers onto the street . Prince Charles, who arrived in the U.S. yesterday evening with his wife, also visited the National Archives today  to view the 1297 Magna Carta and the Declaration of Independence. The document, a successor to the original 1209 charter, was reissued by Edward I as a quid pro quo for extra funds with which to wage war on Scotland. It was also on a tour of the National Archives that Charles learned his uncle once developed a new polo stick.  National Archivist David Ferriero presented the prince with a patent application submitted in 1931 by his uncle, Lord Louis Mountbatten, for a new kind of polo stick. Charles, himself a polo player, laughed and said he had no idea that his uncle had designed a polo stick. He also laughed when shown a telegram from the U.S. embassy in London to the Secretary of State, sent in 1957 seeking instructions to ensure that a toy car that had been given to Charles, then 8 years old, would be working properly when he returned home to play with it. Camilla, meanwhile, visited the Shakespeare Theatre Company. During an afternoon visit to the National Archives, Prince Charles laughs as he's shown a telegram from the American Embassy in London to the U.S. Secretary of State in 1957, asking for instructions on how to operate a toy car that was to be gifted to the then 8-year-old prince .

The couple flew into the U.S. Tuesday night, arriving at Andrews Air Force Base in Washington DC on a private plane. The royal tour has been welcomed by British ambassador Sir Peter Westmacott, who hopes the visit will give a boost to Anglo-American relations. 'I am so pleased to welcome The Prince of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall back to the United States, ten years after their first official visit together,' he said. 'Their trip to Washington and Kentucky will showcase the best of the transatlantic relationship - promoting democratic values, combating climate change, preserving the natural environment, creating opportunities for the next generation - and provide yet another reminder of the essential role the Royal Family play in keeping that relationship special.' Charles and Camilla will also visit Louisville in Kentucky. Next stop: The couple then toured the plantation home of George Washington in Mount Vernon, Virginia .

        "document": "(CNN)The news was stunning to hear: A young woman, 18-year-old Michelle Carter, was charged with involuntary manslaughter for allegedly sending text messages urging her friend to commit suicide. How could a young person -- who was a close friend of the deceased, Conrad Roy, 18 -- allegedly do such a horrifying thing? And what are the legal ramifications of what a teen says online or in a text? But a lesser discussed point this tragic story raises is how quickly a teen can go from normal everyday life to facing severe, life-altering legal consequences. That is why Lisa Green, author of the informative new book \"On Your Case: A Compassionate (and Only Slightly Bossy) Legal Guide for Every Stage of a Woman's Life,\" believes every parent of a teen should have a criminal defense lawyer in mind and at the ready -- just in case. \"To me this is the unrecognized area that parents, particularly parents of teens, miss all the time,\" said Green during a recent interview at CNN's studios. \"So many of our friends have armies of tutors, extracurricular activities, all sorts of angles covered ... but when it comes to the law, there's this black hole.\" Mom arrested for leaving 9-year-old alone at park . Green, a journalist, lawyer and television legal analyst, says people often think of  the law as scary and intimidating and believe they don't need to worry about it because their kid is never going to get into legal trouble. Whether it's a case as serious as Carter's involuntary manslaughter charge, or a simple allegation of vandalism, parents need to be prepared, Green said. \"I cannot count the number of kids I know, good kids, who find themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time,\" said Green. \"I have now two young adults, and when they were going through their teenage years, it was a simple matter of a party that went wrong, a group of kids in the park when the police stop by and have some questions, bringing something to school they shouldn't have. \"And in each of those cases, a little bit of knowledge of the law, a little bit of knowledge of what their rights are, the right way to behave, would have saved parents a heck of a lot of grief.\" Green thinks parents should think about the issue in the same way they would track down a good orthopedist if their child breaks a bone, or the best tutor if their child is struggling before the SAT. Parents' house seized after son's drug bust . \"I am not saying that parents need to go out and get their own law degrees ... but just dipping your finger into the topic will help you understand what's available to you to help you parent better,\" she said. She gives some real-life examples especially in the social media age. For instance, what if a teen is asked by a school administrator to turn over his or her cell phone based on allegations the teen was sending inappropriate texts? What parents should know, Green said, is that a school can't open a cell phone for no reason at all. \"They need to have reasonable suspicion that something's wrong,\" said Green, who said parents would be wise to talk to their teens about what's appropriate and what's not when it comes to handling such requests from school officials. \"If you're asked, as a child, for a locker search, to open a phone, to open a laptop, if it's your property, pause and ask if you could call Mom and Dad,\" she said. \"We can act whether we're lawyers or not as that first line of defense.\" Green also says that parents of college-bound teens should spend a few minutes looking online at the school's code of conduct. \"They don't tell you about it during that fantastic tour with the kid walking backwards as your child is looking around to say, 'Who can I party with?' But it's a really important set of information because different schools have different levels of tolerance\" for activities such as drinking on campus, she said. And even before teens head off to college, parents should know about social host laws, where parents could be held criminally responsible or face civil damages if teens drink alcohol in their home and then go off and do something inappropriate or even tragic. Scary consequences for parents hosting underage drinking . More than 150 cities or counties and 24 states currently have such laws on their books, according to Mothers Against Drunk Driving. In some cases, parents can be held liable even if they didn't know the drinking was taking place. \"It doesn't have to be you with the shaker, like an episode of 'Mad Men,' serving up Manhattans to a group of grateful teens,\" said Green. \"If you've made it possible in your home, if you don't lock your liquor cabinet -- I never did -- and all of a sudden kids are drinking, that could be a problem as well.\" While Green is passionate about educating parents on why they need to think about the law, she stresses that bad behavior by teens still needs to be punished either legally or at home. \"I am not advocating that kids should be absolved of responsibility. If a kid does something wrong, if they broke the law, they ought to be punished appropriately by it. But we also live in a society where we have legal rights, and I want parents to know that they should be aware of what those are so they can help their child use better judgment.\" So if after reading this, you are moved to try to find a criminal defense lawyer, how on earth do you go about finding one? Green's advice is to ask friends and colleagues for referrals and also consult with your state bar association, since you would want someone in your state who has experience with criminal defense issues. Then she says you should call up and interview a few lawyers, asking them everything from how much their services would cost (that can vary), to who would handle the work, to what their philosophy is about the law and teens' rights. \"You may or may not end up being friends afterwards, but that's not as important as feeling secure that your lawyer is approaching the situation in a way that feels right for you.\" Do you think it's important for parents of teens to be aware of the law and their children's legal rights?

        "document": "Life on Earth may have been kickstarted by a series of chemical reactions triggered by two simple but poisonous compounds that were plentiful on our planet four billion years ago. Chemists claim they may have finally solved the riddle of how life first got going on Earth. They have found it is possible to create the three main molecular building blocks of life - DNA, proteins and lipids - from hydrogen cyanide, hydrogen sulphide and ultraviolet light. Meteorite impacts, like the one in the illustration above, may have triggered the creation of hydrogen cyanide that scientists have found can create the three basic building blocks of light in reactions powered by sunlight . Their findings suggest that the basic components for biological cells could have all occurred simultaneously in primordial ponds and streams, coming together to form the first cells. This suggests that life may well have first emerged here on Earth - out of a toxic soup of poisonous gas - rather than being carried to our planet by a comet or meteorite from outer space. RNA stands for ribonucleic acid. It is one of three important molecules that are essential for all known forms of life - as well as proteins and lipids. RNA is formed from strings of nucleic acids, the same building blocks that create DNA. Genetic information in a cell flows from DNA through RNA to proteins. DNA is considered the 'blueprint' of the cell and RNA is what helps translate it. Some life, like viruses, only use RNA and it is thought that some of the earliest organisms on Earth used this molecule. Proteins are considered to be the workhorses of the cell built up from strings of amino acids. These carry out the biochemical reactions that take place in the cell and make life tick. Lipids are fatty molecules that line up in formation that can create protective vesicles. They form the membrane 'walls' of every living cell and give them structure. They are also essential for sending signals out of the cell. But the researchers behind the new study say that meteorite impacts probably still played a key role in giving life a first leg up on the ladder towards existence. They claim that meteorite impacts around four billion years ago - known as the Late Heavy Bombardment - could have carried with them carbon rich material that reacted with nitrogen in the air to produce an abundance of hydrogen cyanide. This poisonous gas could then have dissolved in water and undergone a series of chemical reactions, along with hydrogen sulphide, driven by ultraviolet light. Professor John Sutherland, a chemist at the Medical Research Council's Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge who led the study said: 'Although it necessarily has to be painted with broad brushstrokes, the picture that emerges is of an overall reaction network developing over time in separate streams and pools, according to a dynamic flow chemistry scheme. 'The various products would be synthesized by subtle variations in the flow-chemistry history of the streams and the order in which they merged or ran into pools. 'Although the overall scheme would not involve all the steps of the reaction network taking place simultaneously in \u2018one pot\u2019, the various products would end up mixed together in pools.' Scientists have long believed that the building blocks for life first began occurring one after another although the debate for which came first has been controversial. Meteorite fragments and bedrock in craters like this one could have reacted with hydrogen cyanide dissolved in pools of water to create salts that react with heat and ultraviolet light to create RNA, lipids and amino acids . The researchers behind the new paper propose a number of geochemical steps shown above that could have seen hydrogen cyanide start a series of reactions that led to the creation of amino acids, nucleic acids and lipids necessary for life. First the hydrogen cyanide is dissoved in water (a) and then reacts with metals to create salts (b). These are left behind by evaporation and then undergo changes due to geothermal heating (c). The resulting molecules are swept away by steams and accumulate in ponds where they react further (d). The researchers behind the latest study, which is published in the journal Nature Chemistry, found they could make nucleic acids - a precursor for RNA and DNA - from hydrogen cyanide, hydrogen sulphide and UVlight. They also found the same basic ingredients could also lead to the creation of amino acids, the building blocks of proteins, and lipids which form the protective membranes around biological cells. The conditions necessary to create all of these were found to be the same, meaning a single set of chemical reactions could have given rise to life's basic building blocks simultaneously. Professor Sutherland and his colleagues argue that the early Earth would have been a favourable setting for these reactions. Hydrogen sulphide is thrown out in volcanic eruptions like the one above and may have been a vital ingredient in the formation of the first biological building blocks needed to create living cells, according to new research . One of the great mysteries shrouding the origins of life on Earth is how complex organisms began to take shape. Theory should hold that 'short' fragments of genetic material would have reproduced in abundance, leaving longer strands - and thus complex life - behind. But new research has revealed that longer strands may have thrived in volcanic 'pores' on the young Earth - ultimately allowing life to evolve to the complexity we see today. The research was carried out by a team from the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitaet (LMU) in Munich and published in the journal Nature. They found that water-filled micropores in hot rocks may have acted as the nurseries in which life on Earth began. One crucial precondition for the origin of life is that comparatively simple biomolecules must have had opportunities to form more complex structures. These, in turn, had to be capable of reproducing themselves, storing genetic information in a chemically stable form. Creating longer strands of RNA to store this genetic information would have been essential - but it simply wouldn't have been possible in most conditions on Earth. But LMU physicists led by Dr Dieter Braun showed experimentally that pore systems on the seafloor that were heated by volcanic activity, namely hydrothermal vents, could have served as reaction chambers for this RNA. Hydrogen cyanide would have formed in large amounts due to the bombardment of comets raining down on the Earth a few hundred million years after it formed. Hydrogen sulphide was also thought to be common on the early Earth - thrown out by volcanic eruptions - while the sun would have provided more than enough ultraviolet light. Metal containing minerals that could have catalysed the reactions were also abundant while metal meteorites could also have caused the formation of other crucial elements like phosphate. In their paper, the scientists set out a series of geochemical scenarios that would have led the reactions in different directions to produce each of the necessary building blocks. Evaporation for example could have caused salts for form that could have then been washed into streams where solar radiation would have driven further chemical reactions. Over time the different products would have been mixed together as streams met and mingled into pools. Jack Szostak, a molecular biologist who studies the origin of life at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and was not involved in the study, told the journal Science: 'This is a very important paper. 'It proposes for the first time a scenario by which almost all of the essential building blocks for life could be assembled in one geological setting.'",

The 23-year-old is currently on international duty with Brazil, alongside current Real Madrid defender Marcelo, who is likely to have an impact on Danilo's decision come the end of the season. AS report that it will cost Madrid \u20ac30million (\u00a322m) to bring Danilo to the Bernabeu. Elsewhere in Spain, Mundo Deportivo's front page leads on Gerard Pique, and his comparison to Bayern Munich and Germany legend Franz Beckenbauer. Pique has made the centre-back position his own and is now Barcelona's leader at the heart of defence . Beckenbauer is widely regarded as one of the best defenders ever to have lived, and the Spanish paper have dubbed Pique 'Piquembauer' on their front page. 'The comeback', reads the headline, as Mundo claim Pique has taken on the challenge and is once again a world-class performer in his position. The 28-year-old has made 31 appearances in a Barcelona shirt so far this season, and has confirmed his inheritance of the leadership from Puyol at the Nou Camp, 'gaining weight' in the dressing room in the process. Marcello Lippi thinks Juventus can win the Champions League (left) while Michel Platini also has kind words . In Italy, La Gazzetta dello Sport carry an interview with Marcello Lippi, two-time Juventus manager and World Cup-winning coach with Italy. He claims he can see himself in Massimiliano Allegri, the current Juve manager, and has backed him to win the Champions League this season. Lippi was in charge of the Italy team that won the World Cup in 2006 despite being underdogs in Germany, and thinks Juve's situation in Europe is similar. 'In the Champions League he can do like Italy in 2006,' Lippi told La Gazzetta. 'We weren't favourites, but we won. Lippi can see himself in Juventus manager Massimiliano Allegri (pictured) and has backed him to succeed . 'Max arrived at Juve at the same age I did, he has my pragmatism.' Tuttosport's front page leads on UEFA president Michel Platini, who also has some kind words for his former club Juve. Aside from the Champions League, they are top of Serie A by 14 points and in the semi-finals of the Coppa Italia. Allegri's side fell to a 2-1 defeat at home to Fiorentina in the first leg of their semi-final, but Platini has backed them to make a comeback in the second leg on April 7. 'Juve, this time you can win the cup,' Platini said.",

        "document": "A 66-year-old man told his wife that he feared hospital staff were 'trying to kill him' a day before they put him on a 'do not resuscitate' notice without the consent of his family, an inquest has heard. Michael Richardson, from Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, died at\u00a0James Paget University Hospital in\u00a0Gorleston-on-Sea, Norfolk,  after medics 'played God' with his life, his widow said. The great-grandfather, who died in October 2013, had been ill for several years with a lung condition which caused his breathing to stop but had been given more than a year to live. Heartbroken: Michael Richardson died at James Paget University Hospital after medics 'played God' with his life, his widow, Janet (pictured with her late husband) said told an inquest today. Right, Mr Richardson . Giving evidence at an inquest, his widow, Janet, said her husband had tried to discharge himself the day before his death after becoming concerned about the levels of oxygen he was being given. Speaking at the inquest in Norfolk, she said: 'He said, \"I can't breathe, take me home - I can't stand it any more. They're trying to kill me\". 'I said, \"I love you\", and then he said he loved me too. That was the last time I saw him alive. 'I wish I'd bundled him up and taken him home because at least if he was going to die, he was going to die with some dignity.' The 66-year-old accused medics of playing God with his life after discovering a do not resuscitate (DNR) notice had been placed on him without the consent of the family. The inquest heard the family, who had recently moved to Norfolk from Deal, Kent, only learned of the notice when they picked up Mr Richardson's death certificate from the hospital four days after he died. Janet Richardson (centre, with a photo of Mr Richardson) with daughters Jocelin Taylor (left) and Antonia Richardson (right). The widow claimed she only learned of the DNR order four days after her husband's death . Asked by assistant coroner David Osborne if she had given consent for this, Mrs Richardson said: 'No, nothing at all.' She added: 'I visited the hospital twice a day.  There would have been loads of opportunities for staff to talk to me. If he had been asked about the DNR notice, he would have said no, I know that. 'He used to say, \"some life is better than no life, you're a long time dead\". He was well aware he would die at some point, just not that quickly.' Mr Richardson, who was born in Islington, London, was diagnosed with the lung-scarring condition pulmonary fibrosis  in 2008 and received oxygen therapy at home. On October 24 2013, his condition deteriorated and his family called an ambulance which took him to the hospital. Mrs Richardson said he had been moved between various wards and when she visited him he 'seemed worse than when he went in'. Although his medical notes correctly identified pulmonary fibrosis as his main condition, he was initially treated for emphysema, Mrs Richardson said. When she pointed this out, doctors increased his oxygen levels. She also described how her husband had been left to lie on soiled sheets and was not being regularly washed. Care: Mrs Richardson accused medics at James Paget University Hospital of playing God with his life after discovering a do not resuscitate (DNR) notice had been placed on him without the consent of the family . Nurse Louise Curtis described how staff had initially rushed to resuscitate Mr Richardson after an emergency alarm was activated. But as they tried to save his life, a colleague checked his notes and pointed out the DNR notice so they stopped these efforts. She added that staffing levels that day had been 'unusually low' with herself and two agency nurses responsible for 27 patients. Normally the ward would have been staffed by four or five nurses.",

Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein of Jordan has secured statements of support from the King of Bahrain and Prince Sufri Bolkiah, a senior member of the Brunei royal family. Although neither of the royals will have a vote at the election on May 29 there is a history, particularly in Arab countries, of the ruling family influencing football policy. FIFA Vice President Prince Ali bin al-Hussein is in the running to become the next president of FIFA . The Prince sits alongside UEFA President Michel Platini during a\u00a0CONMEBOL congress on March 4 . That could be important to Prince Ali who has struggled to win support in his own Asian football confederation (AFC) - only one AFC country, his home country Jordan, nominated him to stand. It is by no means certain however that the Bahrain FA will back Prince Ali despite the King offering his support. AFC president Sheikh Salman Bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa is also from Bahrain and has already given his backing to Blatter. Furthermore, the leading powerbroker in Olympic sport Sheikh Ahmad Al-Fahad Al-Sabah from Kuwait is also supporting Blatter. Ali bin al-Hussein has received backing from high profile supporters, including the King of Bahrain (above), . Sheikh Ahmad wields significant influence, especially in Asia as head of the Olympic Council of Asia, and is himself standing for the FIFA executive committee at the end of April. Prince Ali is understood to be buoyed by the royal backing, and also to have taken heart from last week's congress of the South American confederation CONMEBOL, where no formal vote to back Blatter was taken. A report from Jordan's government new agency stated: 'His Majesty King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalif of Bahrain, on Monday, received HRH Prince Ali bin Al-Hussein accompanied by Interior Minister Hussein Majali, and stressed Bahrain's support to Prince Ali's bid for FIFA presidency.' Blatter has three challengers for the presidency: Prince Ali, Dutch FA president Michael van Praag and former Portugal international Luis Figo. Despite being heavily criticised during his reign, Sepp Blatter wants the presidency for a fourth term . Luis Figo (left) and\u00a0Michael van Praag are the two remaining candidates in the presidential race . Last week van Praag said there would be a better chance of victory if there was only one candidate from Europe. He also claimed Figo's plans for funding national associations would 'bankrupt FIFA'. Meanwhile, Germany's outgoing FIFA member Theo Zwanziger has reiterated his belief that the 2022 World Cup should be removed from Qatar if the Garcia report into bidding for the tournament flags up rule breaches. Zwanziger told Bayern 2 radio station: 'The best solution would be not to play in Qatar and to rectify this wrong decision. But that can only happen if the report provides sufficient clues that the awarding broke FIFA ethics rules.'",

Officers may be better employed tackling current threats than historic crimes and failings, Britain\u2019s top policeman suggested last night. Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe called for a \u2018grown up conversation\u2019 about the commitment to investigating decades-old issues. The Scotland Yard boss said he will \u2018never shrink\u2019 from the task of bringing a \u2018bad person to justice, whoever they are, without fear or favour\u2019. But he added: \u2018We have to be better at weighing up the likelihood of success against the risks that those resources might be able to prevent or mitigate in the present day.\u2019 Sir Bernard was speaking in London as a child sex abuse inquiry starts work investigating failings by institutions to protect children. The four-person panel will have statutory powers to compel witnesses and victims will also be able to appear as witnesses. There are concerns that forces are struggling to balance a tidal wave of historic allegations with the danger of present-day criminals. Hundreds of victims came forward in a phenomenon dubbed the \u2018Savile-effect\u2019 after the DJ and entertainer was exposed as a predatory paedophile after his death. In his speech, Sir Bernard also said Britain needs fewer pubs and bars in order to tackle the violence linked to binge-drinking culture. He advocated merging many constabularies to create nine super-forces in a bid to cut costs and bureaucracy. Sir Bernard said police need to be more open about how they manage the risks they face, including the \u00a350 million spent on 42,000 missing children every year. And he said the people should protect themselves from crime in the same way people take steps to ensure they remain in good health. \u2018I believe that keeping the public safe should be just as high priority as keeping them healthy, he said. \u2018I\u2019d like it to achieve the same high profile that prevention has in health over the last 20 years.\u2019 Investigation: Sir Bernard was speaking as a child sex abuse inquiry starts work.

        "document": "Even if all it amounts to is a handful of visits to England's training camp to spend a few hours observing the players and offering some pointers, the prospect of Jonny Wilkinson being involved with the national team is an enticing one. Nothing is certain at this stage, but it is not out of the question that the iconic fly-half will agree to give his input as Stuart Lancaster's squad prepare for the World Cup. If the 35-year-old hero of the 2003 triumph does take on a role of sorts \u2014 and that would appear to be a big if \u2014 it wouldn't be as a coach and it might not even amount to a consultancy, certainly not on a regular basis. Jonny Wilkinson could lend his expertise to England's 2015 rugby World Cup preperations . Wilkinson, who was a fly-half, kicked the winning drop goal to lead England to World Cup glory in 2003 . Wilkinson has been getting involved with rugby coaching and could aid England's World Cup preparations . England coach Stuart Lancaster would not ignore the opportunity to use Wilkinson's know-how . But most England supporters would settle for Wilkinson popping into the HQ in Surrey on his way to the supermarket, if there was any chance of some of that stardust and winner's mentality rubbing off on the class of 2015. It is all about the aura. Here is a man who was once the nation's sporting darling, while in rugby circles he is treated with a mixture of respect and awe. In the south of France, where he worked wonders for Toulon in the closing years of his career, he is adored. When false rumours surfaced at the start of the year that he was destined for a knighthood, they were assumed to be correct. Such an honour would have surprised no one. The current generation of England players grew up admiring his epic deeds. The fly-halves in particular \u2014 George Ford, Owen Farrell and Danny Cipriani \u2014 could learn so much from the maestro. Stuart Lancaster has an established coaching group and there are no plans to expand it, for now. At present, Mike Catt works with the kickers in camp, while another RFU coach, Jon Callard, has also spent time with them, though less so recently. Ford has private sessions with Wilkinson's kicking mentor, the renowned Dave Alred, who has not had a role in the national set-up since the last World Cup. But any chance to tap into the know-how of one of the country's all-time greats, with his legendary work ethic and meticulous approach, would not be casually ignored by Lancaster. Wilkinson has spoken of his interest in the option of working as a specialist coach or tutor, and has done so part-time with Toulon this season. Wilkinson (centre) is revered in Toulon, where he spent the final years of his career as a player . Lancaster already has one 2003 World Cup winner in his coaching ranks in Mike Catt (centre) Wilkinson's input could help England's current fly-halfs such as George Ford . Danny Cipriani (left) and Owen Farrell are England's other alternatives at fly-half . For all his personal accomplishments, he is wise enough to accept that playing pedigree does not necessarily translate into coaching credentials. Talking last autumn, after being invited into England's camp, he said: 'If there is anything I can add, then we can have a little chat, but more importantly I need to learn my trade. I was a player, but just because I knew how to play doesn't mean I've earned the right to tell other people how to do it. 'I'm coaching one week every month in Toulon, learning my way around it. I'm coaching individual skills, mentoring some of the young guys on how to cope with the emotional and mental side of things. I'm really enjoying it, but the biggest mistake you can make is thinking just because you played the game, you already know it.' As a recent retiree who keeps himself supremely fit, Wilkinson could comfortably take on an active role, demonstrating the points he makes. In fact, it would not be a leap of the mind to imagine him matching England's current kickers shot for shot in extended practice sessions. While there is scope to improve the kicking game, both at goal and tactical, Wilkinson is a big admirer of the men currently country's vying for his old shirt. Wilkinson (left) acknowledges that success as a player offers no guarantees to becoming a skilled coach . Lancaster (left) and his England side narrowly missed out on Six Nations glory on Saturday . Wilkinson speaks highly of the abilities of England's current fly-halfs, especially Ford and Farrell . 'George Ford is a fabulous player who produces some amazing touches and is an absolute natural in the way he reads the game,' he said. 'He works hard, wants to improve and as a young guy he is happy to take on responsibility and shows he can deal with it. That makes him a great person to have in that position. 'Owen Farrell is immensely mentally tough and deserves a hell of a lot more credit than he has been getting for what he has done in the last few years. As a young guy, he has said, 'Here is pressure, I will deal with it. Not only that, I will kick your goals for you and stand up in defence and bring this team together'. That is brilliant.' That talented pair would speak highly of their acclaimed predecessor too. It could be a perfect fit. England have the biggest representation on a 12-strong list for the RBS 6 Nations player of the tournament. Jonathan Joseph, George Ford, Ben Youngs and Billy Vunipola feature alongside Ireland's Paul O'Connell, Robbie Henshaw and Conor Murray, Welshmen Alun Wyn Jones and Dan Biggar, Scots Stuart Hogg and Jonny Gray, and Italy captain Sergio Parisse.",

        "document": "Britain's biggest pensions firm has come under fire for exploiting savers after dishing out \u00a349million in pay and perks to its bosses last year. With less than a week before the biggest shake-up in the pensions market for more than a century, insurance giant Prudential was last night accused of \u2018greed\u2019 after revealing the extraordinary awards lavished on its senior executives. MPs and pension experts said the scale of the awards would be particularly galling for millions of savers trapped in poor-value annuities or paying excessive charges. Tidjane Thiam (left), the Pru\u2019s Ivorian chief executive, was the highest paid board member, but this was dwarfed by the \u00a315.4million scooped by fund manager Richard Woolnough (right) Tidjane Thiam, the Pru\u2019s Ivorian chief executive, was the highest paid board member, with a total package of \u00a311.8million last year \u2013 a 36 per cent pay rise from the \u00a38.7million he received the previous year. This takes the total amount he has collected in five years at the helm to more than \u00a341million. The 52-year-old announced his resignation earlier this month and will shortly become chief executive of Credit Suisse. But his pay was dwarfed by the \u00a315.4million scooped by fund manager Richard Woolnough \u2013 who runs almost \u00a335billion of savers\u2019 money for the Pru\u2019s investment arm M&G. Mr Woolnough runs several funds which are widely held in savers\u2019 pensions and investment ISAs. These include the M&G Optimal Income fund, which runs just under \u00a324billion of savers\u2019 money. Prudential\u2019s nine board directors shared a total of \u00a349million in pay and perks last year. Mike Wells, the boss of the insurer\u2019s US arm and the man expected to take over from Mr Thiam, was paid \u00a311.4million. Last night Dr Ros Altmann, a leading pensions expert and a government adviser for older workers, accused Prudential of \u2018short-changing\u2019 savers who took out annuities by offering poor rates. Tidjane Thiam, the Pru\u2019s Ivorian chief executive, was the highest paid board member, with a total package of \u00a311.8million last year . She said: \u2018Over the last few years Prudential has been one of the worst culprits, offering poor annuity rates. 'I would imagine that any saver short-changed in one of its annuities would feel most uncomfortable to know the extra profit this company has made on their retirement fund has helped bump up the pay for its top bosses to a figure they could only dream of earning in a lifetime.\u2019 Today a 65-year-old man with a \u00a3100,000 pensions pot would receive an annual income of just \u00a33,899 from a Prudential annuity. This is more than \u00a3400 less per year than they would get if they shopped around for the best deal. Earlier this year an investigation by the City watchdog found the \u00a312billion-a-year annuity market is not working well for customers, with millions of people trapped in poor deals. John Mann, a Labour member of the Treasury select committee, said: \u2018Savers and particularly pensioners will be incredibly angry at this greed which comes at their expense. The failure in annuities demonstrates why such obscene pay is out of order.\u2019 The payouts are bigger than those handed out to Britain\u2019s biggest banks, which have been the primary focus of anger over fat-cat pay. Lloyds\u2019 chief executive Antonio Horta Osorio was comfortably the highest-paid bank boss in the UK last year, scooping \u00a311.5million. Stuart Gulliver of HSBC was next in the pecking order with \u00a37.6million. In comparison, highly paid pensions bosses have largely managed to avoid the limelight. But the increasingly fierce criticism of the pensions industry \u2013 including accusations of excessive charges and poor annuity rates for savers \u2013 has contributed to growing criticism over pay. Last night Prudential defended the huge payouts. It said profits at the company jumped 14 per cent last year to \u00a33.2billion, while it paid out \u00a3945million in dividends to shareholders, a 10 per cent jump on the previous year. A spokesman said: \u2018The remuneration of our leadership team is closely linked to the strong long-term performance of the business.\u2019",

The launch of Netflix ushers in what is arguably the biggest change to the Australian TV landscape in decades. But the online streaming services will still have to convince Australians - who are among the most prolific illegal downloaders in the world - to pay for content. This could prove difficult, with a new Canstar Blue survey finding that the majority of Australians are still not willing to pay for TV content. Around one in five are willing to pay up to $20 a month for a service that provides a majority of content they would like to see. But this could change in future, with the survey also finding that 23 per cent of young Australians are already utilising online streaming services like Stan, Presto, Quickflix and Netflix.",

        "document": "When number seven for Steven Gerrard's side walked onto the hallowed Anfield turf once again, a roar was heard from all sides of the stadium, as fans welcomed the return of the brilliant, exciting and unpredictable maverick that is Luis Suarez. The Liverpool fan favourite got tongues wagging after refusing to rule out a return in the future, while disappointing the likes of Manchester City after revealing that he would only ever play for the Merseyside club. Speaking to Liverpool TV he said: 'You never know in football what the future holds but if I ever play in England again, I will play for the Liverpool team and not another team.

Liverpool fans loved to see the attacking trio of Torres, Suarez and Gerrard playing at Anfield again .

        "document": "China has been rocked by a hard-hitting film made by a former state TV news anchor which links her baby's tumour to the country's terrible air pollution. Chai Jing's investigative documentary - which has already attracted unprecedented attention from the country's officials - explores the controversial topic of smog in China, one of the most widespread issues in the state. In the opening scene of the documentary, Ms Chai tells the story of her daughter, who was diagnosed with a benign tumour before her birth in October 2013. The 39-year-old goes on to report how a number of newborn babies in China have contracted pneumonia without even leaving home. Scroll down for video . Young victims: Chai Jing, 39, has made a hard-hitting film, exploring the controversial topic of smog in China, one of the most widespread issues in the state . Motherly love: In the opening scene of the documentary, Ms Chai tells how her daughter was diagnosed with a benign tumour before her birth in October 2013 . The film also features an interview with Wang Huiqin (pictured), 6, who lives in highly industrialised Shanxi Province and says she has never seen stars or blue skies . Although Ms Chai does not explicitly link her daughter's tumour to China's air pollution, the film - the first to probe the topic in such depth - has prompted public speculation that the two are connected. It has already been watched by some 200million people and has sparked a firestorm of public criticism over the government's failure to act on the issue in a timely manner. In the 144-minute film, Ms Chai, a former anchor at China Central Television, the Communist Party's mouthpiece, tells how she made the documentary to tell her daughter 'what is smog, where smog comes from and what we shall do with it'. She explains how she found herself pregnant in January 2013, when 25 provinces and cities in China were blanketed by heavy smog. She then gave birth in October 2013, when her daughter had already been diagnosed with a benign tumour. The diagnosis led to Ms Chai quitting her job  at the beginning of last year so she could focus on taking care of her daughter. It was during that period that she began making the film, entitled Under the Dome, she explains. Enveloped: Most cities in China, such as Beijing and Shanghai (pictured), face serious air pollution issues . Price for industrialisation: China burns a large amount of\u00a0petroleum and coal, two major causes of pollution . The film was distributed to various video websites in China on February 28. It received 117 million views in the first 24 hours, according to\u00a0Tencent. Ms Chai's daughter is no longer unwell. But she says in the film that she only took her daughter outside when air quality in Beijing was marked excellent or good. The rest of the time she had to lock her daughter at home 'like a prisoner', she claims. She adds that 175 days during 2014 were graded as polluted in Beijing. The film also includes an interview with a six-year-old girl, Wang Huiqin, who lives in Shanxi Province, a heavily industrialised area in central China. The girl tells Ms Chai in the interview how she has never seen stars, blue skies or white clouds in her life. Stardom: Ms Chai is a highly recognised anchor and investigative journalist in China. She is also a best-selling writer . Controversy: Although Ms Chai does not explicitly link her daughter's tumour to China's air pollution, the film - the first to probe the topic in such depth - has prompted public speculation that the two are connected . China's cities are often hit by heavy pollution \u2013 in the form of smog \u2013 caused by burning a large amount of petroleum and coal. The film has already been widely backed by the Chinese public, as well as a number of officials. Chen Jining, the newly appointed minister of environmental protection in China, was quoted in an article on People's Daily\u00a0as saying:\u00a0'I want to thank her. She has wakened up the public to pay attention to the environment from a public health perspective. 'I think (she is) worth our respect.' Self-protection: A girl puts a mask on her dog in Shijiazhuang, capital of north China's Hebei Province, during a smog attack . Fake sunrise: An LED screen on the Tiananmen Square shows what a sun-rise looks like in heavily polluted Beijing . And Gao Mingyong, a senior media commentator in China, wrote on ifeng.com: 'Under the Dome is the best example of self-initiated media which can represent the logic of the internet, but its significance is far more than this.' Ms Chai financed the making of the film by herself which cost $160,000. It's believed that Ms Chai gave birth to her daughter in the U.S, leading to her being branded a hypocrite and traitor by some.",

        "document": "This is the comical letter that a schoolboy penned to his teacher after being told off for talking during a German lesson. Rather than being apologetic and remorseful the defiant 13-year-old brazenly tells his language master, 'I am not sorry.' In the hastily written note, scrawled on a scrunched up piece of lined paper, he says he was only speaking to a friend for a 'few seconds' was not 'constantly talking.' The teen, who has not been named, added 'I do not like German' and signed off the letter with 'I have nothing else to say for myself so I'll just tell you I had chips for lunch.' This is the defiant handwritten note that a schoolboy penned to his teacher after being told off for talking . The hilarious letter was uploaded to Twitter by the boy's brother, and was retweeted thousands of times in just 12 hours. The picture was uploaded with the caption 'My brother had to write an apology to Mrs *****. Look what he's put down.' The boy is a pupil at\u00a0Oldmachar Academy, in Aberdeen, Scotland. The full note reads: 'I turned around and talked to ****** for a few seconds. I was not talking constantly. Also, everyone else was talking too and I got this work for speaking to ****** for a second. 'I don't think it's fair and I'm not sorry.. I already done the work. I do not enjoy German. 'I need to write to that line down there but I have nothing else to say for myself so I'll just tell you I had chips for lunch yesterday.' The cheeky chap's father said: 'He does hate German. I had no idea that he had written this letter and this is all news to me. 'I turned around and talked to ****** for a few seconds. I was not talking constantly. Also, everyone else was talking too and I got this work for speaking to ****** for a second. 'I don't think it's fair and I'm not sorry.. I already done the work. I do not enjoy German. 'I need to write to that line down there but I have nothing else to say for myself so I'll just tell you I had chips for lunch yesterday.' 'I don't know if he would have had the guts to hand it in.' Twitter users found the letter hilarious, and it has so far received over 2,000 'favourites'. One user wrote: 'At least Mrs ***** knows what he had for lunch. That's something anyway.' Another added: 'This is sensational.' Someone else wrote: 'That's brilliant.' Other examples of hilarious letters written by children include one from a student which read: 'Dear Mrs Storz. You are the best music teacher ever because my last music teacher choked a boy.' One letter from one pupil to another reads: 'Dear Brody. Miss P made me write you this note. All I want to say sorry for is not being sorry because . I tried to feel sorry but I don't.' There was no one available at the school for comment.

        "document": "It's the run of games which will go a long way to deciding whether Manchester United are playing Champions League or Europa League football next season. Four of the Premier League's top six - Tottenham, Liverpool, Manchester City and Chelsea - in their next fives games. Make-or-break for Louis van Gaal and his players. Other than the home clash with relegation-threatened Aston Villa on April 4, Sunday's visit of Spurs would appear to be United's best hope of three points over the next month and a half. But recent results tell a different story. Marouane Fellaini, Michael Carrick and Wayne Rooney (L-R) look dejected during defeat by Arsenal . Christian Eriksen scores Tottenham's winning goal against Manchester United at Old Trafford last season . Eriksen is mobbed by his team-mates after helping Tottenham to their second consecutive win at Old Trafford . 29.09.2012 - Manchester United 2-3 Tottenham . 20.01.2013 - Tottenham 1-1 Manchester United . 01.12.2013 - Tottenham 2-2 Manchester United . 01.01.2014 - Manchester United 1-2 Tottenham . 28.12.2014 - Tottenham 0-0 Manchester United . Having won 17 and drawn five of their previous 22 games against Tottenham, United now find themselves without a win in their last five matches with the north London outfit. Mauricio Pochettino's men battled to a 0-0 at White Hart Lane in December but Spurs have won their previous two visits to Old Trafford, ending a 23-year wait for victory with a 3-2 triumph in September 2012. United had gone 26 games without defeat at home to Spurs in all competitions - winning their previous nine - before a Jonny Evans own goal and strikes from Gareth Bale and Clint Dempsey gave Andre Villas-Boas' men a memorable win in Manchester. And Tottenham proved that result was no fluke last season when goals from Emmanuel Adebayor and Christian Eriksen sealed a 2-1 victory for Tim Sherwood's side. Gareth Bale scores during Tottenham's 3-2 victory at Old Trafford in September 2012 - their first in 23 years . Clint Dempsey celebrates after netting Spurs' winner against Sir Alex Ferguson's side . Then Tottenham manager Andre Villas-Boas shows his delight after the final whistle . Two draws at White Hart Lane - 1-1 in January 2013 and 2-2 in December 2013 - were sandwiched between those victories, taking Spurs' unbeaten run to an impressive five games. So impressive, in fact, that they are only the third team to manage such a run against United. Liverpool did the same between 2000 and 2002, winning four consecutive games against their great rivals - including two at Old Trafford - and drawing once. Blackburn Rovers also went five games unbeaten against the Red Devils between 2004 and 2006, winning at Old Trafford in September 2005 and coming out on top in two fixtures at Ewood Park. Just three points behind United going into Sunday's game, Tottenham have a major incentive to pull off their third successive win at Old Trafford and become the first team to go six games unbeaten against United in the Premier League era. Hugo Lloris keeps out a shot from Robin van Persie during a 0-0 draw between the sides in December 2014 . Spurs striker Harry Kane (left) battles for the ball with Jonny Evans in this season's clash at White Hart Lane . Football data analysts BSports believe a Manchester United home win is easily the most likely outcome . Victory would mean Pochettino's side would be out of the Champions League places by goal difference only, something they will be confident of improving upon in upcoming games against Leicester, Burnley, Aston Villa and Newcastle. And in  Harry Kane, the Premier League's hottest striker and Premier League Player of the Month for February, Spurs have a man capable of causing United's frail defence all sorts of problems. Their games against in-form Liverpool, local rivals City and league leaders Chelsea will be extremely tough but Van Gaal should be just as wary of Tottenham. After decades of domination, Spurs have quickly become United's bogey team.",

        "document": "Police in Malawi have arrested a man for trying to strangle to death a 16-year-old albino boy, while Tanzanian authorities have arrested 200 witchdoctors in a crackdown on the shocking trade. The suspect had been on the run after he was caught trying to kill the 16-year-old at his home in February and will soon appear in court facing a charge of attempted murder. Across many parts of Africa, albinos are killed for their body parts, which are then sold to witchdoctors who use them for rituals and potions. Police in Malawi have arrested a man for trying to strangle to death a 16-year-old albino boy. Pictured are children being kept at a centre to prevent them becoming victims of the black market trade in body parts . Six albinos have been killed in the southern African country of Malawi since December. File image used . Six albinos have been killed in the impoverished southern African country since December, according to the Association of Persons with Albinism in Malawi. Boniface Massah, the organisation's director, said Malawian albinos are 'living in fear of being attacked or killed' because of the recent spate of murders. Belief in witchcraft runs deep in Malawi and albino body parts are often used in rituals. Even the bodies of dead albinos are sometimes exhumed and sold. Earlier this week, UN human rights chief Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein denounced attacks against albinos as 'stunningly vicious, with children in particular being targeted'. Countries in east and west Africa are worst affected, and Tanzania near Malawi has one of the highest attack rates, where body parts sell for around $600 and an entire corpse fetches $75,000. Meanwhile, Tanzanian police said they had arrested 225 unlicensed traditional healers and soothsayers during a special operation carried out in several parts of the east African country and due to be extended to all 30 regions. Two women carry their albino children on May 5, 2014, in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania . Advera Bulimba, a police spokesperson, said: 'Some of those arrested were found in possession of items like lizard skin, warthog teeth, ostrich eggs, monkey tails, bird claws, mule tails and lion skin.' He added the police campaign would target the entire network of gangsters, traders and witchdoctors, adding that 97 of those detained had already appeared in court. The statement also appealed to religious leaders, traditional elders, politicians and journalists 'to continue the awareness campaign against superstitious beliefs that are holding back the development of our country.' The announcement comes after President Jakaya Kikwete said the ongoing attacks against people with albinism, whose body parts are used for witchcraft, were 'disgusting and a big embarrassment for the nation'. In the most recently reported attack, a six-year-old albino boy's hand was hacked off with a machete and his mother assaulted as she tried to protect him. Savage attack: A group of men hacked off six-year-old Baraka Cosmas' right hand on Saturday night . On Tuesday, police said seven suspects had been arrested in connection with that attack, which left the boy and his mother hospitalised. And last week a Tanzanian court sentenced four people to death for the murder of an albino woman whose legs and right hand were hacked off with an axe and machete. The killers who were convicted also included the husband of the murdered woman. President Kikwete met with albino activists last week, promising to do more to stop the wave of violence. 'The government has long tried to do everything possible to stop the killings, we are very serious with this,' he said. 'But we still need to enhance our efforts to bring to an end these killings, which are disgusting and a big embarrassment to the nation.' Albinism is a hereditary genetic condition which causes a total absence of pigmentation in the skin, hair and eyes. It affects one Tanzanian in 1,400, often as a result of inbreeding, experts say.",

        "document": "A startling video has emerged showing an officer putting his hand around a woman's throat then forcing her to the floor at a Massachusetts police station. The footage, taken in February 2013, was released this week following a $1 million federal lawsuit filed by the woman, Maylene Maldonado, against the Chicopee police officer, Daniel Major. Major has resigned from the department, WCVB reported. The footage shows him and two other officers restraining Maldonado, who was arrested for allegedly slapping a police officer after she admitted to drinking and smoking PCP, Mlive reported. In the video, the then-24-year-old repeatedly tells the officers that her lip ring is giving her pain and asks them to help her remove it. Arrest:\u00a0Maylene Maldonado can be seen screaming as she is taken into custody in February 2013 . Attack: One of the officers, Sergeant Daniel Major, then abruptly grabs her neck and holds on . But as she continues to scream, Major suddenly grabs her around the neck and continues to hold on as his fellow officers do nothing. Then they all pull the woman to the ground. While on the floor, Major shouts: 'Shut the f*** up!' Maldonado was charged with resisting arrest and assault and battery on a police officer. In her lawsuit, which also names the other officers, Maldonado has accused the officers of assault and battery and civil rights violations, and accuses the city of failing to properly train its officers. She also claims she never received medical treatment for the injuries she allegedly sustained. Maldonado, from Springfield, was arrested after her friend's car got stuck in a snowbank in Chicopee and officers, who were called to the area following reports about a man with a knife, saw her running to a nearby gas station and went to check on her. She admitted to drinking and smoking the hallucinogenic drug PCP and then got into an altercation with police officers when they tried to see her license. Holding on: She struggles as Major holds on to her neck - while the other officers stand back and do nothing . 'Attack': The officers then push Maldonado to the ground, where Major says: 'Shut the f*** up' She slapped an officer across the face and apologized, according to the criminal complaint, but was arrested and taken to the police station where the alleged assault unfolded. The case has also caused divisions within the department. Thomas Charette, the acting chief at the time of the 2013 incident, defended Major's actions as appropriate because Maldonado was high on PCP and allegedly spat blood during her arrest. 'Sergeant Major made several attempts to speak softly and calmly with Ms. Maldonado in order to calm her and complete the booking process,' Charette said, according to WHDH. 'However, she was either unwilling or unable to understand simple instructions and kept insisting that Sergeant Major repeat himself.' An internal police review determined he had 'acted admirably', Mlive reported, and a clerk-magistrate's hearing agreed. A district court judge  reviewed the recording and he was charged with assault and battery in November 2013. Major, in court in November 2013, was charged with assault but an internal review found he did nothing wrong, which the current police chief has disputed. Major has since retired but now faces a lawsuit from the woman . But because internal affairs investigation found no wrongdoing, former Chicopee Mayor Michael Bissonette told ABC40 that his hands were tied. Despite his predecessor's ruling, the current chief, William Jebb, has said Major did not act appropriately and handed the video over to City Hall officials, Mlive.com reported. 'We want to make it clear, it's a different administration,' Chicopee Police Officer Mike Wilk told ABC. 'Two officers have retired and a lot of people have asked about releasing it. Chief Jebb and (Mayor) Kos want it to be transparent department. That's why we released it today.' Charette ultimately retired in July 2014 after Jebb beat him to secure the job of police chief. Mayor Richard Kos' office said: 'The city takes these allegations very seriously and the Chicopee Law Department will file a timely answer to this lawsuit once served.'",

        "document": "(CNN)Manchester United defender Jonny Evans and Newcastle United striker Papiss Cisse have been charged by the Football Association for allegedly spitting during an altercation in Wednesday night's Premier League game at St James' Park. In a statement, English football's governing body said the players had been charged \"in relation to an alleged breach of FA Rule E1[a] in that in or around the 38th minute of the game the two players spat at each other. \"The incidents were not seen by the match officials but [were] caught on video.\" The players have until 6pm GMT on Friday to respond to the charge, and could face six-game bans if found guilty. Both Evans and Cisse released statements the day after the incident, with Evans saying: \"I would like to make it clear that I did not spit at Papiss Cisse.\" Cisse's statement said: \"I reacted to something I found very unpleasant. Sometimes it is hard not to react, particularly in the heat of the moment. I have always tried hard to be positive a role model, especially for our young fans, and yesterday I let you down.\" Spitting at another player is considered beyond the pale by professional footballers, and former Liverpool midfielder Dietmar Hamann, now a TV pundit, told the BBC's Match of the Day programme the incident had been \"disgusting.\" \"This is not acceptable,\" he said. \"There are kids watching. Something has to be done. The behaviour towards each other and the referee is deteriorating on a weekly basis.\" Ex-Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes said he did not believe Evans had deliberately spat at Cisse, telling BT Sport: \"Look, it's not very nice. I think Jonny is spitting on the floor. \"I know Jonny -- he's not that type of person. If he wants to do that then it's not hard to miss, is it? He's only stood a yard away from him. What Cisse does afterwards is unforgivable.\" And former Liverpool player Steve McManaman told the channel: \"Cisse stands up and spits right at Jonny Evans' neck from about six inches. It's absolutely disgusting. \"Two wrongs do not make a right. If Jonny Evans has spat at him then it's wrong, but for Papiss Cisse to get up and react like that is absolutely disgusting. We talk about bad tackles, but that is worse.\"",

Mr Xie told the male pupils from Nanguang High School in Fujian to stay behind after class on Thursday because they were being too loud. He made the students crouch on the floor while he played on his phone and put his bare feet on their backs,\u00a0People's Daily Online reported. Mr Xie, who has been a teacher for 27 years, was dismissed after the Nan'an City Education Department saw a picture on social media. The image shows both students being made to kneel on the ground in their school uniforms in front of a crowd of pupils. Mr Liu, headteacher, said Mr Xie, who is in his 40s, was supervising a small self-study group around 7.30pm when the two students were too noisy. The Year One pupils - thought to be aged between six and seven - were taken into a different room and told to kneel on the ground. Mr Liu said the footstool photo was taken as a joke and added that Mr Xie, who was in charge of disciplining the male students at the school, 'performed well in his work and was extremely talented'. Nan'an City Department of Education said it took immediate action. It requested the school apologise to students and parents, and said that student counselling should also be offered. Stronger ethics and appropriate styles of teaching would be implemented at the school, the department added. Mr Liu said that a school representative had already gone to the homes of the two students to apologise formally. Boys and girls sit in lines outside\u00a0Nanguang High School in Fujian, where the incident happened .

        "document": "Bryan Robson has paid Chris Smalling a huge compliment by likening his recent performances to those of Paul McGrath and Gary Pallister. Five years after signing for United, Smalling is yet to convince many United fans he and Phil Jones are suitable long-term replacements for Nemanja Vidic and Rio Ferdinand, who left Old Trafford last summer after long and distinguished careers. The 25-year-old has been the object of a few taunts, most recently in the Manchester derby last November when he was sent off in the 39th minute. Manchester United defender Chris Smalling (centre) has impressed Bryan Robson in recent weeks . Robson believes Smalling's passing has been 'crisper' during his displays against Arsenal and Newcastle . Smalling, already on a booking, showed a complete lack of composure by hacking down James Milner in the corner to earn his second yellow and United went on to lose 1-0 against a City team that was there for the taking. Smalling has since shown signs of improvement, though. His commanding performance in last week's 3-0 victory over Tottenham caught Robson's eye and the former United captain thinks that bodes well for Louis van Gaal ahead of Sunday's trip to Anfield. Robson said: 'Chris is a good defender. I have seen him improve over the last few games. 'I even thought against Arsenal and Newcastle away, his passing was a lot better, a lot crisper, so he has come on to a good game, he is in good form at the moment and that will be important at Liverpool.' Smalling kept 26-goal striker Harry Kane quiet last Sunday and the former Fulham man ventured forward, striding confidently with the ball at his feet on a few occasions. The end product was not good enough to suggest Van Gaal has a new Beckenbauer in his squad just yet, but Robson was so impressed by Smalling's confidence that he felt moved to liken the centre-back to two United greats in Pallister and McGrath. Smalling kept a close eye on Tottenham striker Harry Kane during Manchester United's win against Spurs . The former lifted 10 trophies at United and the latter would have won much more than the 1985 FA Cup had he not fought a long-running battle with alcoholism which eventually cost him his place at the club. 'Paul McGrath could do that and so could Gary Pallister,' Robson said when invited to liken Smalling's display to a figure from the past. 'When you keep possession at the back sometimes it's really important that your defenders break past the forwards and they get into the midfield area. 'That means one of your midfield players should be able to get space and I thought Chris did that particularly well against Tottenham and that made it difficult for the Tottenham players.' Smalling seemed pleased to be compared to two defensive stalwarts of the Sir Alex Ferguson era. Robson has compared Smalling to former Manchester United defender McGrath . Smalling has also been compared with Gary Pallister (left, pictured with Peter Schmeichel in 1996) 'It's a great feeling know that people are taking notice,' Smalling said. 'I am just hoping I can keep it up and keep a good run and contribute to our results.' Smalling will have to be at his very best again on Sunday at Anfield. Van Gaal has warned the centre-back - and the rest of his team-mates - they must not get sent off in this volatile fixture. As well as pride and bragging rights, a place in the top four is at stake. Liverpool have not lost since they fell 3-0 at Old Trafford in December and a victory for the hosts would move them above United into fourth for the first time since August. Robson thinks victory against Liverpool would deliver a significant blow to the Reds' top-four hopes and is not ruling out a second-place finish for United, who trail City by just two points after their loss at Burnley last weekend. 'Yes, (second) is a realistic target,' the former United captain said. 'We have to play City and Arsenal at home and if we beat both of them all of a sudden your points tally is looking really good. 'When you talk about the top teams it seems as if you look at it like you are going to get beat all the time and the lads have proven that they can perform really well against a top team like Tottenham. 'And a win at Liverpool at this stage of the season would be a fantastic result for us.'

        "document": "Scared for her life: Model Anna Duritskaya, 23, is under police protection in Ukraine after reporting a 'threat to her life from unidentified individuals' Ukraine has put the girlfriend of slain Russian opposition politician Boris Nemtsov under state protection after she received death threats. Model Anna Duritskaya, 23, is now under the guard of SBU secret services and the police. Kiev also said today that she would not return to Moscow over the probe into the death of the Vladimir Putin foe. 'We will not let her go back to Russia,' said Anton Geraschenko, an aide to the Interior Minister. 'If Russian investigators need to talk to her, they will have to come to Ukraine.' The announcement came as another of Russia's leading opposition figures vowed that he and his supporters will not be intimidated by as he walked free from a 15-day spell in jail. Alexei Navalny, who had been convicted of handing out leaflets calling for an opposition rally, said he would continue his staunch criticism of Vladimir Putin's government despite the Mr Nemtsov's murder seven days ago. Emerging unshaven from a Moscow detention centre this morning, Mr Navalny said: 'This act of terror hasn't achieved its goal, it will not frighten me or my comrades. We will not reduce our efforts, we will not step back.' A key figure in Boris Yeltsin's 1990s government, Mr Nemtsov was the most prominent figure in Russia's liberal opposition to be killed during President Vladimir Putin's 15-year rule. The 55-year-old was shot four times in the back by a gunman in a passing car as he walked hand-in-hand with Miss Duritskaya on a bridge across the Moskva River on Friday night, in the shadow of central Moscow's St Basil Cathedral. The Ukrainian woman - physically unhurt in the attack - revealed the death threats to police in Kiev, who said today they were providing her with protection. 'On March 5, Anna Duritskaya, who is a witness in the case in the murder of Russian opposition politician Boris Nemtsov, turned to the Ukrainian police in the Kiev Region with a statement on a threat to her life from unidentified individuals,' said the prosecutor-general's office in Ukraine. The statement offered no information on who might have issued the threats, according to the Associated Press. The model was staying with her parents since returning to her home country. A relative in Ukraine said she was 'in a bad mental state'. In the aftermath of Mr Nemtsov's assassination, Miss Duritskaya was repeatedly questioned by Russian investigators, and she complained that she was held under armed guard and unable to leave the country. However, she returned to Ukraine last week. 'This act of terror will not frighten me or my comrades': Opposition leader Alexei Navalny said he would continue his staunch criticism of Vladimir Putin's government despite the Mr Nemtsov's murder . Gunned down: Boris Nemtsov, 55, (left) and 23-year-old Miss Duritskaya (right) were walking hand-in-hand through Moscow after having dinner on Friday night when he was shot four times in the back . As thousands gathered in Moscow to pay their last respects at Mr Nemtsov's funeral, Putin insisted the Russian law enforcement authorities would do 'everything' to solve the crime. However, Nemtsov's eldest child, Zhanna Nemtsova, 30, revealed that investigators had not spoken to a single member of his close family six days after the murder. They believe his 'cruel and barefaced murder' was because of his political opposition to the Kremlin. Yesterday a top Nato official suggested Putin was responsible for Mr Nemtsov's death as he accused the Russian president of silencing dissent at home while seeking to turn Ukraine into a failed state. 'We've seen that the victims are not just in eastern Ukraine, with the brutal murder of Boris Nemtsov last Friday,' NATO Deputy Secretary General Alexander Vershbow said. Speaking to members of parliament from EU countries at a conference in Riga, Mr Vershbow went on: 'While we don't know who pulled the trigger, we do know that Boris Nemtsov was a powerful voice for democracy and against Russia's involvement in Ukraine ... (and) was among those vilified as \"traitors\" and \"fifth columnists\" in Russia's official propaganda.' 'We will not let her go back to Russia':\u00a0Anton Geraschenko, an aide to Ukraine's Interior Minister, said Miss Duritskaya would not return to Moscow over the probe into the death of the Vladimir Putin foe . Honoured: People  applaud as workers carry the coffin of Kremlin critic Boris Nemtsov during a ceremony at the Sakharov centre in Moscow, where his body was laid in state after he was shot dead on Friday . Mr Nemtsov, a father of four, first gained an international profile after being spotted by former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher as a future leader of Russia. He was Russia's deputy prime minister from 1997 to 1998 during Boris Yeltsin's presidency, but found himself on the fringes of the country's politics after a tanking economy forced Yeltsin's resignation. The politician founded a number of opposition movements after leaving the Russian parliament in 2003 and he had served as the co-chair of the opposition Republican Party of Russia - People's Freedom Party since 2012. It has been reported that Nemtsov angered Putin's government two years ago when he charged that billions of dollars had been stolen from funds designated for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, his hometown. In January 2011, he was sentenced to 15 days in jail after being arrested at a New Year's Eve protest rally for 'disobedience towards police'. Murder: Flowers lie at the scene of Mr Nemtsov's murder, while police divers search the Moskva River for the gun that was used to gun him down. He was a key figure in Russia's liberal, pro-West opposition . Pro-West in his ideology, Mr Nemtsov had told U.S. diplomats he wanted to take Russia on a pro-EU, pro-Nato course, including eventual membership of both organisations, according to a diplomatic cable released by Wikileaks. 'The key, Nemtsov argued, was to present this strategy as the only viable choice for Russia,' wrote a U.S. embassy attach\u00e9 in the note dated February 2006. But, the diplomat continued, 'Nemtsov also realizes that his association with the Yeltsin era will probably limit support for any initiative with his name on it, and he is counting on the next generation of politicians to carry the liberal banner.' Putin has claimed Mr Nemtsov's murder - yards from the Kremlin - was a 'provocation'.",

        "document": "(CNN)Ferguson City Manager John Shaw resigned Tuesday in the wake of a scathing Justice Department report. The report blames Ferguson, Missouri, police and courts for abusive behavior that disproportionately targets African-American residents. \"Over the last several months I have done everything in my power to work with countless groups to bring about positive change and strengthen our community,\" Shaw wrote in his resignation letter. He continued: \"During this time I have also worked closely with the Department of Justice to identify opportunities to improve, and then moved quickly to implement its recommendations for change. \"And while I certainly respect the work that the DOJ recently performed in their investigation and report on the City of Ferguson, I must state clearly that my office has never instructed the police department to target African Americans, nor falsify charges to administer fines, nor heap abuses on the backs of the poor. Any inferences of that kind from the report are simply false.\" Shaw's resignation was announced the same day the City Council voted 7-0 on a mutual separation agreement with Shaw. Residents elect City Council members, who in turn appoint the city manager. The city manager directs and supervises all city departments, including the Police Department. Along with other officials, Shaw was heavily criticized by the Justice Department report, which found that authorities in Ferguson frequently saw residents as \"sources of revenue.\" In fact, the city enjoyed so much success in issuing tickets and fines that Ferguson, population 21,000, was ranked in the top eight of the 80 municipal courts in St. Louis County by having more than $1 million in revenue in 2010, the report said. In one March 2012 email, the captain of the patrol division reported to Shaw that court collections the previous month reached $235,000 -- the first month collections exceeded $200,000. The city manager reported the email to the City Council, congratulating police and court staff on their \"great work,\" the report said. When Ferguson court revenues exceeded $2 million for the whole of 2012, the city manager responded to the police chief in an internal email: \"Awesome! Thanks!\" according to the federal report. The DOJ's probe came after public outcry over the death of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown, who was shot by Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson in August. Wilson, who was not indicted on any charges, has resigned from the police department. But when Ferguson resident Sue Schmidt defended Wilson at Tuesday's City Council meeting, she heard vocal objections from those in the crowd. \"I'd like to say a lot of people in this room owe Darren Wilson an apology,\" Schmidt said, prompting laughter by some in the audience. \"The same justice report that you're basing all your opinions on cleared him 100%.\" CNN's Jennifer Feldman, Holly Yan, Sarah Aarthun and Michael Martinez contributed to this report.",

        "document": "Veteran BBC DJ Paul Gambaccini has accused the police of launching a 'witch hunt' against innocent celebrities to cover up their failures over Jimmy Savile. The 65-year-old said he had suffered 'a year from hell' as officers tried to drum up their case against him after he was arrested in 2013. He was finally told he would not face any sexual assault charges in October. Mr Gambaccini also claimed he had been 'left out to dry' on bail for months longer than necessary because the police did not want people to see a former Radio 1 DJ cleared before their case against his former colleague Dave Lee Travis had concluded. Scroll down for video . The 65-year-old veteran DJ Paul Gambaccini said he had suffered 'a year from hell' by officers trying to drum up their case against him after he was arrested in 2013 . Mr Gambaccini\u00a0told the Home Affairs Select Committee the police had launched a 'witch hunt' to protect their reputation . Travis was convicted of molesting a 22-year-old researcher in September, just weeks before the case against Mr Gambaccini was dropped. Mr Gambaccini blamed his arrest on the 'moral panic' sparked by the revelations over Savile which exposed the police's own failures to stop the prolific paedophile. 'I faced the full weight of the state with unlimited financial resources for 12 months for no reason - it was a completely fictitious case,' he told the Home Affairs Select Committee. He said:\u00a0'Someone whose identity we do not know, who I call the Wizard of Oz, the person sitting behind the curtain, pulling the levers, setting off smoke and light shows, decided \"I've got a great idea, let's have a witch-hunt, let's divert the attention of the public from the police who knew about but failed to stop Jimmy Savile in his lifetime and shine that spotlight instead on his contemporaries and we'll get perverts from show business in the 1970s and 1980s''.' The furious BBC DJ added:\u00a0'When you open a website and a phone line - as the police did - for the dedicated purpose of accusing celebrities, then you are going to get some people who are responding to the offer of money and attention.' He told MPs there was no excuse for his treatment and urged them to overhaul the law to protect innocent victims from spending months on bail. 'It's obvious they wanted to keep me in the frame, because my name got out to the press '[but] there is no possible excuse for leaving someone out to dry.' He added: 'You don't need a witch hunt to enforce the law.' He also accused the Crown Prosecution Service of carefully timing the extensions of his bail to coincide with big sex abuse cases, such as the Rolf Harris trial, in order to avoid public scrutiny over their flimsy case against him. Mr Gambaccini blamed his arrest on the 'moral panic' sparked by the revelations over Jimmy Savile which exposed the police's failure to tackle abuse over decades . Mr Gambaccini told MPs he was 'left out to dry' until the end of the case against Dave Lee Travis. He also said he was re-bailed to coincide with the case against Rolf Harris (right) While Mr Gambaccini was making the accusation it emerged Harris had been stripped of his CBE, awarded to him by the Queen . The 84-year-old Australian was awarded the CBE in 2006 for his services to entertainment but it has now been retracted following his sentencing to six years in prison after being found guilty of sexually assaulting girls as young as seven-years-old. Mr Gambaccini said he had lost faith in the British justice system and revealed he had lost \u00a3200,000 in wages and legal fees after his arrest. The US-born DJ was re-bailed several times during his ordeal \u2013 and only found out about one after it had been reported to the BBC and ITV. Mr Gambaccini accused the CPS of having 'sat on the case' for eight months and said he 'enthusiastically' supports 28-day bail limit.\u00a0He said the only reason for delay is to 'get someone else to accuse you'. Mr Gambaccini had his bail extended  when publicist Max Clifford was sentenced for indecent assaults . He told the committee that during that time, his bail was extended on seven occasions with only 'vague' explanations from police, but he gradually realised that the dates often coincided with important developments in the Yewtree investigation. Bail was extended on May 2, when publicist Max Clifford was sentenced for historic indecent assaults, on June 30, hours after the conviction of Rolf Harris and on September 12, when former Stoke Mandeville doctor Michael Salmon appeared in court charged with rape, he said. 'You know what they say. Twice is a coincidence, three times is a trend,' said Mr Gambaccini. 'It was kind of interesting when I was rebailed the same day Max Clifford was sentenced. It was kind of infuriating when I was rebailed the same day Rolf Harris was convicted. But then when I was rebailed again when Michael Salmon was charged, I thought 'OK, what they are doing here is trying to bury the news of my being rebailed forever, because if anybody wanted to write an article about Yewtree on those days, it wouldn't be about me, it would be about the other suspects'.' When his bail was extended to September 15, he suspected a link to the trial of Dave Lee Travis, which was due to end on that date. 'I thought, 'This is the most obvious thing in the world. They are sitting on me until they are finished with Travis, because they don't want the Travis jury to know that a former Radio 1 DJ can be innocent'. 'I do believe - though I don't have any evidence for this - that they were just sitting on me until Travis was finished,' he said. The veteran disc jockey told MPs that no one was above the law, but said celebrities were more vulnerable to false allegations because more people know them. He added: 'This person went after me because I was the famous person in his neighbourhood.' After dropping their case against him, the CPS revealed that the allegations against him involved two underage boys who were around 14 and 15. Other celebrities including comedians Jim Davidson and Jimmy Tarbuck have had their names dragged through the mud after Yewtree investigated them over decades-old allegations. Paul Gambaccini accused the police for launching a 'witch hunt' against innocent celebrities . Dubbed the Professor of Pop for his encyclopedic knowledge of music, Paul Gambaccini had been a BBC radio DJ for 16 years when he was arrested last year. The 65-year-old, who is openly gay, was born in New York. He gained citizenship to the UK in 2005 despite starting with with the Corporation in 1973 as a reporter on John Steel's Radio 1 show, Rockspeak. He read politics, philosophy and economics at Oxford University as well as studying at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. Despite his success, Mr Gambaccini said he was victim to homophobic treatment within the BBC where his personnel file was reportedly marked with a Christmas tree as he was 'camp as Christmas'. He entered into a civil partnership with model Christopher Sherwood in 2012. Following an ITV documentary in 2012 which exposed the depraved paedophilia of Jimmy Savile, Gambaccini publicly condemned the Jim'll Fix It star, describing him as 'an enigma'. 'He was not all good, he was not all bad, he was an enigma.,' he said on Daybreak. 'You just didn't mess with Jim. 'He was the governor, because after all he had been the first great club DJ, he had been the originator of Top Of The Pops and you just let him have his turf. 'And none of us were interested in going there. 'At social occasions we would all be together, but Jim would not be. He had his own life,' he said on live television. He added he had been waiting for 30 years for the public to be made aware Savile's abuse. 'I've been waiting for this to come out for 30 years, but then he did raise millions for charity. 'This comes out when he's dead because he had an imperial personality in showbiz, and I'm not talking about personal life.' 'Once he was phoned and he said, 'Well, you could run that story, but if you do there goes the funds that come in to Stoke Mandeville Hospital. 'Do you want to be responsible for the drying up of the charity donations?' And they backed down.'",

        "document": "Posing with an AK47 assault rifle over each shoulder, this British student has been named as a 'senior Islamic State commander' responsible for recruiting hundreds of his countrymen. Nicknamed 'al-Britani Afro' because of his hairstyle, rapper Raphael Hostey, 22, has allegedly been instrumental in luring Britons to become fighters or jihadi brides in Syria. The news came as a shock to his neighbours, who remembered him as an innocent-looking 12-year-old boy obsessed with Manchester United. Menacing: A masked Raphael Hostey, 22, brandishes AK47s in a photo on Twitter while wearing a floppy hat . Fresh faced: Hostey was remembered by his neighbours in Moss Side, Manchester, as an innocent boy . Just a few years later he would shun his British upbringing and leave his wife and child to join IS. Posting raps about jihad on Twitter, he has urged young women considering joining IS to 'come as soon as possible'. Hostey's identity was revealed by an alleged Syrian double agent arrested in Turkey, who was involved in recruiting the three teenage girls from east London who flew to Syria last month. Hostey left behind a wife and child to travel to the country in 2013 with two friends, Mohammed Javeed and Khalil Raoufi, both 20. All three were students at Liverpool John Moores University. Javeed and Raoufi are thought to have died in fighting. Hostey, from Moss Side in Manchester, is known among jihadis for his afro hairdo. Under the name Abu Qaqa, he is thought to have used social media to lure many more British recruits to IS, including jihadi brides. In raps posted on Twitter, he has urged video game-loving followers to stop playing 'Call of Duty and Fifa' and come 'to the khalifa' (or head of a Muslim state). He also posed wearing a floppy fisherman's hat with his face covered and assault rifles on each shoulder. Commander:\u00a0Under the name Abu Qaqa, he is thought to have used social media to lure  British recruits to IS . Football fan: Hostey was remembered as a 12-year-old boy who was obsessed by Manchester United . Since travelling to Syria, he is believed to have risen to the rank of senior commander. Hostey was injured in fighting but has not come home and still brags of his exploits on social media sites. On Tumblr he told 'a sister in London' to contact him privately when she asked for advice on life under IS. Born Raphel Saiho Hostey, he preferred to be known by the more anglicised name Raphael. Yesterday, neighbours said he 'loved playing football with other local lads'. They also revealed his family home was raided by police in September, with officers searching it for days. Siful Khan, 27, who lived opposite the red-brick semi for 15 years, said he was 'shocked' to hear about Hostey's alleged activities, adding: 'He used to wear a Manchester United shirt. He loved them.'",

Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany (right) was dropped to the bench for the visit of Leicester . Kompany has come in for criticism this season following a number of high-profile errors for the champions . He gave away a penalty against Arsenal, could have done better with both of Barcelona's goals in a 2-1 Champions League defeat and was dispossessed by Philippe Coutinho in the build up to Jordan Henderson's strike for Liverpool at Anfield. A poll in the local newspaper, the Manchester Evening News, saw fans vote to drop Kompany from the squad. Pellegrini has backed the Belgian, who he described as 'a great player', but rested him for the clash with Nigel Pearson's bottom-of-the-table visitors. Midfield pair Samir Nasri and Fernandinho dropped out of the squad altogether while Pablo Zabaleta and Edin Dzeko were alongside Kompany on the bench. Wilfried Bony, a \u00a328m signing from Swansea City, made his full debut alongside Sergio Aguero while Martin Demichelis partnered Eliaquim Mangala at the heart of defence in place of Kompany.

        "document": "(CNN)An Iraqi man watching his first snowfall in his new American hometown was shot and killed by an unknown assailant, according to Dallas police. Authorities have stepped up patrols in the neighborhood where Ahmed Al-Jumaili lived -- and died -- in their effort to find out who killed the 36-year-old early Thursday, as he and his brother stood in the parking lot of his apartment complex watching the snow. Al-Jumaili's wife was with them taking photos. Dallas police spokesman Jeff Cotner said Al-Jumaili, who recently immigrated to the U.S., had never seen snow and \"just like all of us, a pretty snowfall brings the child out in us.\" There is \"extreme heartache ... and no shortage of sadness for this beautiful young man who had just come to this country 20 days ago,\" said Alia Salem, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations in the Dallas and Fort Worth area. CAIR became involved in the case immediately after the shooting, according to Salem, because of \"a heightened sense of awareness with regard to hate crimes against Muslims.\" Salem said the Muslim community wanted to know whether the shooting death was random or whether  Al-Jumaili was targeted. Police say they have no indication so far that it was a hate crime. When shooting broke out, Al-Jumaili cried \"I'm hit!\" according to Cotner, basing that on statements from witnesses and the victim's relatives. He ran to his apartment nearby and died a few hours later. Police did not say where Al-Jumaili was struck or how many times he was shot. Some residents reported seeing two to four men enter the apartment complex on foot through a vehicle gate before the shooting, according to Cotner. He said there was no interaction between the men and Al-Jumaili and his family. In black-and-white soundless surveillance video, one person who appears to be carrying a rifle is seen running just ahead of a second person, Dallas police Officer Monica Cordova said. The second person is shown walking at a slower pace, holding what appears to be a handgun in his right hand. Approximately 13 seconds later, another person comes into view and passes by the camera, followed by a fourth individual who is walking, she said. From the vantage point of the camera, it is difficult to make out any of the features of the suspects or even the gender, although police have said they are looking for four black males. Witnesses say multiple shots were fired from what is believed to be a rifle. Cotner said police are conducting tests to find out whether more than one rifle was used in the shooting, but he said he could not reveal the make or model of the weapon. Cotner said Friday that other than that, police have little to go on. \"We can't solve this crime alone,\" he said. Authorities are appealing to the public to contact them with any information that might help the investigation. North Texas Crime Stoppers is offering a $5,000 reward for information that leads to an arrest and an indictment, police said. Salem is encouraging anyone with information about the shooting to share it. She said there are online campaigns underway to help raise funds for the family's expenses, as well as an effort to raise additional funds to contribute to the reward. CNN's Vivian Kuo contributed to this report.",

A southern New Jersey man who is in prison for killing a 6-year-old boy has admitted sexually assaulting a 2-year-old in a separate case. Osvaldo Rivera, 34, pleaded guilty to sexual assault Monday. Under terms of the plea deal, Rivera faces 15 years in prison to be served concurrently with the 110-year sentence he is already facing after a jury found him guilty of the murder of 6-year-old Dominick Andujar\u00a0and the sexual assault of that boy's 12-year-old sister, Amber in September 2012. The sexual assault of the younger child, a 2-year-old boy, was the month before that. The Camden County Prosecutor's Office said DNA evidence submitted to a state database helped link Rivera to the crime. Rivera is scheduled to be sentenced in the toddler assault case April 17. 'Rivera had to be held accountable for the crime he committed against this toddler, regardless of having been previously sentenced to life in prison in another case,' Assistant Prosecutor Christine Shah told Philadelphia Inquirer. In July 2014, a Camden jury found Osvaldo Rivera guilty of the murder of Dominick Andujar, as well as charges of attempted murder, aggravated sexual assault, burglary and weapons violations. Scroll down for video . Lifetime behind bars:\u00a0Rivera (left) faces 15 years in prison to be served concurrently with the 110-year sentence he is already serving in the 2012 killing of six-year-old Dominick Andujar (right) Crocodile tears: Rivera, pictured here sobbing during his\u00a0arraignment September 4, 2012, told police he was high when he broke into the Andujar family's home in Camden and assaulted a 12-year-old girl . At around midnight on September 2, 2012, Rivera broke into the Andujar family's home in Camden and attacked then 12-year-old Amber Andujar as she slept on the couch. Amber began to scream, which awoke 6-year-old Dominick - and he rushed to his sister's aid. The small boy fought with the attacker and managed to free his sister in the process. Amber, who was bleeding after being slashed in the throat by Rivera, ran to a neighbor's home to call for help. By the time police arrived on the scene, the brave 6-year-old boy was dead after having his throat slashed. Little hero: Dominick had his throat slashed by Rivera as he rushed to protect his big sister, Amber (right) from her assailant . Capture: Rivera was found hiding behind a mattress in a home in Camden after the attack . Defiant: Amber Andujar (left) survived despite having her throat cut so deeply that paramedics could see her vocal chords . Rivera fled the house after killing Dominick, and Amber was later seen running through the neighborhood, screaming for help while bleeding profusely from the throat. Emergency responders said the cuts were so deep they could see Amber's vocal cords. She later helped officers locate her rapist by telling them he was known by the nickname \u2019Popeye\u2019 and lived in a Camden apartment. Police tracked him down to an apartment in the city and found him hiding between an upturned mattress and the wall. According to investigators, during his questioning Rivera had revealed that he had smoked 'wet,' a combination of marijuana and PCP, prior to the killing. During Rivera's sentencing last December, a defiant Amber Andujar declared: 'Today I stand here as a survivor. Even though he took a part of me away, in the end, you did not win.'",

'When he is fit...' seem to be the same, old four words that crop up when Rosicky becomes the topic of discussion yet, even at the age of 34, he still knows how to make Arsenal tick. Tomas Rosicky earned the nickname 'Little Mozart' in Germany and he continues to make Arsenal tick at 34 . Olivier Giroud celebrates with Rosicky during their Premier League win against Queens Park Rangers . Rosicky has found minutes hard to come by at Arsenal previously but injuries can prove problematic . Pulling on the yellow of Dortmund from 2001, the all-round midfielder's potential was recognised. Remember Nike's Scorpion advert in 2002? Francesco Totti, Thierry Henry, Patrick Vieira, Paul Scholes, Ruud van Nistelrooy, Ronaldo, Roberto Carlos, Luis Figo and Ronaldinho, among others, playing in a 'secret tournament' hosted by Eric Cantona. Then, among the world's finest footballers, was a 20-something Rosicky. More than a decade on he is in his mid-thirties, and getting better with age. Take the former Sparta Prague youth's cameo against Everton on March 1, for example. There was a moment when Rosicky chased the ball from Phil Jagielka, to Ross Barkley, to Steven Naismith, then back to Barkley, and won the tackle. It merited a standing ovation, before he settled the bag of nerves the Emirates Stadium had become with an 89th-minute goal to make it 2-0. 'This geezer's unreal, how is he 34? Still producing moments of class like that, he's a brilliant player,' one supporter said in his analysis on ArsenalFanTV afterwards. Rosicky scores against Everton previously as he came on as a substitute with just eight minutes remaining . Rosicky shoots to make it 2-0 to Arsenal against Everton on March 1 and settle their nerves . Rosicky should start against Manchester United but is not guaranteed to do so under Wenger . Rosicky mocked up as his nickname 'Little Mozart' 87 - vs QPR (March 4) 8 - vs Everton (March 1) 9 - vs Monaco (February 25) 14 - vs Crystal Palace (February 21) 18 - vs Middlesbrough (February 15) That's exactly how it comes \u2013 in 'moments'.\u00a0The Czech Republic captain doesn't devastate week in, week out yet he is guaranteed to put in a shift. The mentality to pass sideways is lost on Rosicky, who prefers to move the ball quickly and forward, showing as much energy and pace as those with years on him in the Premier League. Yet Rosicky\u00a0\u2013 a one-two kind of player, who bleeds the Arsenal way\u00a0\u2013 has averaged just 19 games per Barclays Premier League season under Wenger in his nine years in north London. The injury-prone playmaker has been unlucky, rupturing his knee tendon in 2008 before requiring surgery on an\u00a0Achilles\u00a0tendon in 2012. It cost him more than two years, and a niggle has always seemed to be round the corner since. Minutes have been hard to come by. Eighteen against Middlesbrough in the FA Cup, 14 against Crystal Palace in the Premier League, and just nine in the 3-1 defeat by Monaco in the Champions League at the Emirates. His eight minutes against Everton led to a rare start against Queens Park Rangers, and Wenger should persist with the playmaker. There is no doubt the Arsenal manager likes the man due a testimonial next year if he signs a contract extension.\u00a0'If you love football, you love Rosicky,' purred Wenger after their 3-2 win against Brighton & Hove Albion in the FA Cup fourth round. Rosicky treated that match as an exhibition.\u00a0His assist for Mesut Ozil's first half goal was ridiculous enough before a no-look pass led to a one-two that allowed Rosicky to score a volley in the second. You may remember it better for Phil Neville declaring he would 'two-foot him' if he tried that in his neck of the woods, but most saw it as sheer class from a thinker that views football akin to chess. Rosicky makes a no-look pass against Brighton which pundit Phil Neville found disrespectful . The Czech midfielder used the same move a number of times during Arsenal's 3-2 defeat of Brighton . During interviews Rosicky can look uneasy, like a teenager making a television debut, not a player just one cap short of a century for Czech Republic. Modesty, can be another way to put it. This week we heard Zlatan Ibrahimovic, 33, has years left. Can Rosicky keep being his tireless self? Well, a Jaguar Land Rover may be aged but, when it's only got so many miles on the clock, it runs as good as any.\u00a0Rosicky has been seen to by mechanics on the treatment table far more than he deserves but, with him now fit, Wenger should start the 34-year-old against Manchester United on Monday, then watch him go.",

        "document": "Roy Hodgson is confident in Harry Kane's ability to shine for England, it is just a case of whether there is space for him in the upcoming squad. This has been quite the season for the 21-year-old, whose 24 goals in all competitions is far and away the best tally from any English striker this term. That form has impressed Three Lions boss Hodgson, who has strongly hinted recently that Kane will earn a first senior call-up in two weeks' time. England manager Roy Hodgson is open to the possibility of calling up Tottenham striker Harry Kane . The Spurs front man has is a regular in the England Under 21 set up and has been in great form for his club . Kane was far from his best in the Capital One Cup final but Hodgson said he thinks the striker is 'ready' It is not just the Spurs man vying for a striking berth, though, with a number of other in-form, uncapped players hoping to be involved against Lithuania and Italy. Saido Berahino, Danny Ings and Charlie Austin have all impressed for their clubs this season - but it is Kane who is the main talking point. 'He's in my thoughts of course, he deserves to be,' Hodgson said, speaking at the London Football Awards, which raises funds for national charity, Willow. 'He's scoring goals for one of our top teams in the Premier League but I know him anyway, he's done a lot of good work for the Under-21s. Burnley striker Danny Ings (right) is among the names for a call up to the Three Lions first team . QPR's Charlie Austin (left) and West Brom's Saido Berahino (right) have both been in fine scoring form . 'What pleases me most is young players are getting their chance to play. In the past 19, 20, 21-year-olds would be loaned out or would have to sit back and wait for their chance. Now more and more of them are taking the chance when they get it. 'I'm delighted for him and we'll see when I select my squad at the end of month if he's in it.' Asked whether Kane was ready to make the step up to the senior side, Hodgson said: 'He's ready. If he wasn't ready he wouldn't be playing for Tottenham and scoring lots of goals. 'The question you ask is has the player got the quality and talent we're looking for and is there a space for him? 'If he comes in then someone's going to drop out and most forwards we've got have done quite well in the autumn. 'But I can't include everyone unfortunately. It's not always a question of are they good enough, it's a question of is there space at this time.' However Kane is the one gaining all the attention having scored 24 goals in all competitions this season . Wayne Rooney, Daniel Sturridge and Danny Welbeck look set to be involved in the squad, while Rickie Lambert and Jermain Defoe are other experienced forward options when the national team reconvene after a four-month break. 'I am looking forward to it, we all are,' Hodgson said. 'Certainly I and my coaching staff are. I hope the players are looking forward to it, too. 'It will be nice to see them again. We did plan a little meeting in January but we found another way of staying in touch with them. 'It will be nice to see them physically again and I hope to see them in as good a shape as I thought they were last autumn.' Hodgson was speaking at the London Football Awards, which raises vital funds for Willow - the only national charity working with seriously ill young adults aged 16 to 40 to fulfil uplifting and unforgettable special days.

Christina Leos, a former preschool teacher told a court that Ryan Hemphill, 33, allegedly choked her during an S&M session. Hemphill, who attended Hofstra University School of Law in New York before working as a legal advisor, has been charged with second-degree strangulation, menacing, criminal obstruction of breathing and weapon possession, the New York Post reports. Christina Leos, (pictured) a former preschool teacher told a court that Ryan Hemphill, 33, allegedly choked her during an S&M session . A document read by the paper says the victim who met Hemphill on dating website eHarmony was left with cuts on her mouth and bruises to her wrist and elbow. During pretrial hearings, prosecutors said the couple made a sex tape where he pretended to be a 'TSA agent, searching her body cavities,' papers state. Leos told the jury that when she tried to break up with\u00a0Hemphill in February 2013 he became violent and he\u00a0grabbed her and picked up a Bowie knife before telling her he would slit her throat. Hemphill denies the charges.\u00a0A document read by the paper says the victim who met Hemphill on dating website eHarmony was left with cuts on her mouth and bruises to her wrist and elbow. She said they made up the next day but then had another row the following month. 'He grabbed me and started strangling me,' Leos said, weeping. 'He had one hand on my neck and one covering my mouth and pushing down on my nose. That's when I realized I can't breathe.' She said Hemphill finally released her and she fled and called the police the following day. Hemphill denies the charges. Hemphill also had over a dozen homemade porn videos - he is seen choking, water-boarding and torturing prostitutes, prosecutors said, . 'One of the objects we recovered is a baton, looks like a police baton, and inside, if you undo it, is a sword,' prosecutor Sara Weiss said. 'He is in multiple videos holding that sword to the neck of blindfolded women, women he, on some occasions, urinates on, while he makes them recite prayers.' The details of those videos were banned at trial, after his defense lawyer objected.",

        "document": "The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall chat happily as they give the corgis a bath while the Queen looks cheerful as she enjoys breakfast in bed. But while these might look like unusually candid snaps of the Royal Family, in reality, they are a clever spoof created by artist Alison Jackson. Inspired by next week's Mothering Sunday, Jackson has tried to imagine how you might treat your mother when she happens to be the Queen. Giving the corgis a bath: Charles and Camilla give the Queen's corgis a bath in a lurid pink bathroom . And according to Jackson, that means hosing down the corgis and carefully giving boiled eggs a regal makeover, complete with bearskin and crown covers. The next photo shows Charles and Camilla, who, as a mother herself will be expecting some treats of her own next Sunday, bathing the corgis in a vivid pink bathroom before drying them off with a patriotic Union Flag towel. Amusingly, the royal couple are seen following the bath up with a blow dry, with Camilla grimacing as Prince Charles accidentally blows hot air in her face. Next comes the big reveal, with the Queen looking thrilled as she is presented with her breakfast tray, a card that reads 'Keep calm and reign on' and three pots of the Body Shop's Vitamin E moisture cream. Anyone for a blowdry? Charles' poor aim leaves Camilla needing to close her eyes . A card fit for a Queen: Prince Charles is seen filling in a card that bears the slogan: 'Keep calm and reign on' Decoration: Charles is also seen giving a trio of boiled eggs a regal makeover, complete with a crown . Finally, Her Majesty is seen sharing her toast soldiers and eggs with her freshly washed - and now very happy - corgis. Jackson is no stranger to reinventing the Royal Family, having previously worked on 'photos' of all the senior royals, including the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry. Others to feature in her work include Pippa Middleton, who was the subject of her Christmas pastiche, which depicted Miss Middleton desperately attempting to wrap up a corgi for the Queen. More risqu\u00e9 depictions of the Royal Family include a photo of the Duchess of Cornwall on the treadmill clutching a gin and tonic and another of Camilla, this time smoking a cigarette. Doing the wrapping: A suited Charles and a dressing gowned Camilla wrap up their gifts for the Queen . Breakfast in bed: The Queen, clad in a fetching green nightie, looks delighted as she is given her breakfast . Some for you too: The freshly washed corgis are then shown getting to share Her Majesty's meal . One particularly amusing set claims to go behind the scenes of Prince George's 2013 Christening, with one photo showing the Queen looking horrified as her great grandson is sick on her. Others show a nude William and Kate in the bath with George and another in which the Duchess of Cambridge carefully changes her son's nappy. The latest set of photos were created as part of a 'Treat your Mum like a Queen' campaign being run  by the Body Shop ahead of Mothering Sunday. Campaign: The photos were taken to promote The Body Shop's 'Treat your Mum like a Queen' campaign .",

        "document": "(CNN)A dark intersection. A church van full of parishioners. And tragedy. That's about all police in Glades County, Florida, had to work with early Monday, hours after a van with 18 people inside ran a stop sign, crossed a four-lane highway and plunged into a shallow water-filled ditch. Eight people died. Ten others, including a 4-year-old child, were injured, according to police. Investigators don't know why it happened,  Florida Highway Patrol spokesman Lt. Greg Bueno told CNN affiliate WPBF. The driver died, and police haven't been able to interview passengers yet. \"Our hearts go out to the families of the victims,\" Bueno said. \"It breaks your heart to see something like this happen.\" Some relatives of the crash victims, all of whom were from the Independent Haitian Assembly of God in Fort Pierce, gathered at the rural intersection Monday morning. Others went to the church. \"We've lost a lot of family members, church family,\" Phillipe Dorce, who said he lost his father, told WPBF. \"All we can do is pray (to) God to help us out. Pray for us. It's very sad for us.\" Linda Dolce told the news site TCPalm.com that her grandmother died in the crash. She'd arrived from Haiti six years ago. \"She loved singing and helping people,\" TCPalm.com quoted her as saying. \"She was exciting; she was the best lady to us.\" Laura Lochard told the site that her uncle died in the crash, leaving behind four children, the youngest of which is 16, whom he brought to the United States from Haiti. He was like a father to her, too, she said. \"It's never easy to lose a person, but I have to be strong,\" she told the site. \"I'll never forget his smile.\" A pastor at the church, Sereste Doresma told CNN that parishioners had attended a revival in Fort Myers and had left Sunday afternoon. \"This is a very difficult day for us today,\" he said. The van apparently was traveling east on State Road 78 when it ran a stop sign at U.S. Highway 27 early Monday, authorities said. It then crossed all four lanes of U.S. 27 and stopped in a ditch that was partially filled with water. No one saw the accident on the rural stretch of roadway that's frequented mostly by commercial traffic, Bueno said. One of the passengers flagged down a passing vehicle, whose driver called police, the trooper said. Police had to remove the seats of the van to remove passengers, Bueno said. Among other things, investigators are looking into the capacity of the van. It appeared to be rated for 16 passengers, Bueno said. Of the passengers, all were adults except for the 4-year-old, who was in stable condition at a  hospital, Bueno said. Two of the adult passengers were in critical condition, he said. Passengers were being treated at four hospitals.",

The unnamed China Airlines flight attendant began developing symptoms for the disease - also known as German measles - on March 14. Four days later, doctors confirmed she had German measles and was placed in quarantine, the People's Daily Online reported. Incubation: The air stewardess on the China Airlines flight (not pictured) contracted the disease in February . But the woman, from northern Taiwan, may have infected a number of people during the incubation period - including passengers on the flights. The Chinese Centre for Disease Control (CDC) is now hoping to follow up with 1,558 people who travelled on China Airline's flights between February 21 and February 28, according to Asia One. It is thought 686 Taiwan nationals and 872 international passengers came into contact with the stewardess. But so far, it has only managed to contact 72 of the individuals - and has encouraged anyone who may have travelled on the flights to come forward. Six of the flights were international - four between Taiwan to Japan, and two between Taiwan and Singapore. The CDC is contacting the appropriate authorities in each country to track down the last of the international passengers. Search: But she may have come into contact with as many as 1,558 people before symptoms arrived . Rash: An example of the rash rubella causes . German measles is one of a number of similar viral infections that children commonly pick up at school. These infections, called enteroviruses or adenoviruses, cause fine pink rashes and mild fevers. Rubella - sometimes known as German measles - can cause serious damage to a developing baby if caught by a pregnant woman so it is important to keep an infected child away from pregnant women. The condition has an incubation period of two to three weeks, but actually only lasts for three to five days. An infected child will be infectious from a week before symptoms of the illness appear until four days after the patient appears to have recovered. China Airlines is the flagship carrier for China, and is based in Taiwan. It operates about 1,300 commercial flights every week to destinations around the world .",

        "document": "One in five gay teenagers in schools across Britain are being subjected to bullying by teachers or other adults, new research has shown. Another third of gay male pupils said they left school without being taught anything about HIV or safe sex, despite a spike in infections nationwide. A survey by the National Aids Trust (NAT), which quizzed more than 1,000 gay or bisexual men aged 14 to 19, also found that more than half had experienced some form of discrimination. More than half of gay teenagers said they had been bullied at school. While 99 per cent said they had been targeted by a classmate, 39 per cent said their tormentor was a teacher or adult (file image) Of those 99 per cent said they had been targeted by another pupil, while 75 per cent said they received online abuse, reports The Independent. However, another 39 per cent said the bullying had been at the hands of a teacher or another adult at their school. Deborah Gold, the chief executive of NAT, said: 'It's an incredibly high number. 'The idea that teachers or other adults at school are sometimes responsible for bullying and discrimination is utterly unacceptable.' The survey also showed a worrying lack of education among young men about the spread of HIV and safe sex, despite them being in the most at-risk group in the UK. Two thirds of those surveyed said they had not been given information about testing for the killer virus, while a third were given no information about the spread of HIV. Another three quarters were also unaware of the drug PEP, which can help prevent infection if it is given to a patient within three days of them being exposed to HIV. A third of teenage boys said they had been given no information on HIV or safe sex, while two thirds said they didn't know how to test for it, despite being in the most at-risk group (pictured, the HIV virus) Three quarters of pupils also said they had been given no information on same sex relationships during sex educations lessons. Ms Gold added: 'The number of young men who have sex with men who are contracting HIV is increasing. I think there's an absolute link between the lack of this education at a time when people need it and the consequences of that.' While education on HIV is required as part of the science curriculum, it is only recommended as part of social and health education classes, with campaigners calling its application 'patchy'. The most recent figures from Public Health England show that HIV infection rates among men who have sex with men are at an all-time high, and are continuing to rise. In 2012 there were 3,250 new diagnoses of HIV among this group, pushing the total to more than 40,000, of which around 7,300 were unaware they had the virus.",

        "document": "Ahead of Mother's Day this weekend, Katie Price has revealed the highs and lows of caring for her disabled son, Harvey. The 12-year-old, whose father is former Manchester United footballer Dwight Yorke, has 'Prader-Willi syndrome' (PWS), a rare genetic condition that causes a wide range of problems. He is on the autism spectrum, has limited vision and can't walk far unaided. Every day, he has to take six types of life-saving medication. Scroll down for video . Katie Price pictured with her 12-year-old son Harvey on today's This Morning . Mother-of-five Katie, 36, said caring for him can be challenging but she has the full support of her own mother,\u00a0Amy Price, 62, who appeared on today's This Morning with her and Harvey. 'People say \"how do you cope?\" but I don't know any different,' Katie told presenters Eammon Holmes and Ruth Langsford. 'He is hard work, he does play up for mummy sometimes, don't you Harvey,' she said to him, to which he cheekily replied, 'yeah, babe.' Katie said one of the biggest challenges is controlling Harvey's hunger. A symptom of his condition is a constant desire to eat which can lead to dangerous weight gain. 'He just wants to eat, eat, eat and if we're not looking he will steal food,' Katie said. 'He's a big boy because of his thyroid and with Prader-Willi everything is about food.' When they go on a family holiday, they have to ensure they are near a hospital 'in case something happens' and daily life can be difficult because Harvey's behaviour is so unpredictable. Katie's mother, Amy, left, helps care her grandson who was born with a rare genetic condition . But as he approaches his teenage years, Katie said Harvey is also be a delight as his personality shines through. He loves to play instruments like the piano and drums and to draw. He produced a picture he had made especially for Eammon and Ruth during his appearance on the ITV show. He told them that he loves listening to music and his favourite song is Adele's Skyfall. On his health progress, grandmother Amy said: 'He doesn't have to use a braille machine which is a real bonus because we never thought he would be able to see let alone be able to read.' Katie, who won Celebrity Big Brother earlier this year, said she gets a lot of support from her husband Kieran Hayler, 27. 'He is so good with him,' she said of Kieran's relationship with Harvey. The couple have reconciled after Kieran cheated on Katie last year while she was pregnant with his daughter, Bunny, who was born last August. They also have a son, Jett, 19 months, while Katie has also two children with ex-husband Peter Andre, Princess, nine, and Junior, seven, as well as Harvey. The former glamour model said caring for Harvey is 'hard work' but she 'doesn't know any different' The Price family appeared on today's This Morning to raise awareness of Harvey's conditions . The former glamour model said her home will be a 'mad house' this Sunday as they will celebrate Mother's Day together and she will cook for her mother Amy. Earlier this year, Katie found herself embroiled in a controversy over using taxpayer's money for the care of Harvey. During her appearance on Celebrity Big Brother, Katie Hopkins said the multi-millionaire should pay for her son to have a driver to take him to and from school instead of relying on the government. Harvey currently travels 50 miles daily from his home in West Sussex to south London, after his local specialist school was shut down. On the show, Katie claimed it would be 'ridiculous' to pay for it herself, suggesting the car could cost as much as \u00a31,000 a day. She also insisted she pays 'over-the-odd taxes' which should entitle her to the same benefits as other parents. Earlier this year, Katie, pictured today, had to defend her right to use taxpayers' money to help transport Harvey to and from a school that can meet his needs . Ruth Langsford holds up a picture Harvey drew for her and husband and co-presenter Eammon Holmes . In a statement released by her management at the time, she said: 'Where any child that is placed in school out of the immediate home area it is the Local Authorities duty to provide transport that meets the child's needs. 'This is common practice for all disabled children as there are not enough suitable schools available to them. 'The cost of the school placement together with transport is not means tested as it is provided for the child. 'Local Authorities do not have special needs schools locally as these have been closed during the last 15 years as it was deemed a cheaper option to transport children out of borough. Harvey waves at the cameras as he and Katie arrive at the ITV studios for their TV appearance . Katie, pictured with husband Keiran at the Cheltenham Festival earlier this week, said he's great with Harvey . 'If Harvey's school was on his doorstep, as with schools for healthy children, then this would not apply but it was the Government's choice to close the special needs schools.' Meanwhile, on today's This Morning, Katie addressed rumours other whether she will appear on another popular reality TV show - Strictly Come Dancing. 'I'd love to do Strictly but no-one has asked,' she said.",

        "document": "Real Madrid are hoping that a win against Levante on Sunday night will help them make peace with their fans, who have turned on the team after a recent poor run of form. Carlo Ancelotti's men have come under fierce criticism after squandering their lead at the top of La Liga, with Marca's front page on Sunday referring to the situation as a 'pressure cooker'. Levante are the visitors to the Bernabeu, in what AS have described as a 'trial run' for next week's El Clasico. The match at the Nou Camp on March 22 will go a long way to deciding this season's La Liga champions, and Ancelotti will be desperate to reclaim Madrid's spot at the top of the table. The front page of Marca leads with the headline, 'Pressure Cooker' ahead of Real Madrid's game on Sunday . Madrid face Levante at the Bernabeu on Sunday night, while Barcelona beat Eibar 2-0 on Saturday . There will be changes in the starting line-up for the Levante clash, the Spanish papers claim, with Keylor Navas expected to get the nod ahead of Iker Casillas. The Spanish veteran made a number of high-profile mistakes against Schalke in the Champions League last week. Sergio Ramos and Luka Modric are also expected to start, in order to get themselves ready for El Clasico. Marca carry a quote from Madrid boss Ancelotti, who has stated that his team are 'hurt, but won't let our heads drop'. Barcelona continued their good form on Saturday, comfortably beating Eibar 2-0. The win means that they have extended their lead at the top to four points - and it is up to Madrid to close the gap with victory on Sunday. In Italy, Juventus won 1-0 against Palermo, and are now gearing up for their Champions League game midweek . Morata scored the winning goal, and Tuttosport's headline (left) reads: 'Borussia, we're coming' Mundo Deportivo's front page hails the 'solid leaders', who came through the game ahead of a decisive week against Manchester City and then Real Madrid. They write that Lionel Messi was once again decisive, scoring both of his side's goals, one from the penalty spot and the other a 'great header'. Messi has taken his tally to 32 league goals for the season, overtaking rival Cristiano Ronaldo in the process. In Italy, much of the focus is on Juventus ahead of their Champions League clash with Borussia Dortmund. Massimiliano Allegri's side beat Palermo 1-0 to 'send a message to Borussia', who they beat 2-1 in the first leg of their Champions League last 16 game a fortnight ago. Elsewhere, Inter Milan boss Roberto Mancini has labelled Yaya Toure his 'son', noting: 'With him, what an Inter!' There has been much speculation over the Ivorian's future at Manchester City, and Mancini has been honest in admitting his interest in the midfielder.",

        "document": "At first glance The Fliers and Explorers Globe appears to be an ordinary antique, hidden in a small over-looked office in downtown Brooklyn, at the end of a nondescript hallway. On closer inspection, however, you will discover it is actually one of the world's most fascinating relics, celebrating the giddy heights of exploration and adventure. What makes the\u00a0artefact\u00a0precious is not its beauty or age, but for the inclusion of the inked signatures and routes of nearly every single famous\u00a0explorer and aviator in modern history, from Sir Edmund Hillary, to Neil Armstong and\u00a0Amelia Earhart. The American Geographical Society's Fliers and Explorers Globe: The signature of Amelia Earhart, the first female aviator to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean, is prominently featured . The society acquired the 18-inch globe in 1929 as a gift from AGS president John H. Finley.\u00a0He invited early heroes of exploration and aviation to draw their routes and sign their names . Hillary was immortalised on the spherical relic, along with more recently, Ann Bancroft, who was the first woman to successfully finish a number of arduous expeditions to the Arctic and Antarctic . This 18-inch globe is hidden beneath a dark cloth in the headquarters of the American Geographical Society, the oldest established national geographical organisation in the US. The valuable tradition of the globe signing started in 1929, when the society president, and\u00a0editor-in-chief of the New York Times, John H. Finley would personally go down to the Lower Manhattan docks to welcome returning adventurers. Explorers would ink their routes and names on the prized object, documenting their piece of history in the moment it happened. Among those commemorated is Amelia Earhart\u00a0who set records becoming the first woman to fly across the Atlantic Ocean in 1928, and was the first individual to fly over both the Atlantic and Pacific. Tragically the aviation pioneer mysteriously disappeared in 1937 as she was trying to circumnavigate the globe from the equator, and was legally declared dead in 1939. On May 20, 1927, pilot Charles Lindbergh embarked on the world's first solo non-stop flight from New York to Paris. Enduring a 33.5-hour crossing, the 25-year-old was victorious and received international stardom, and his route was marked onto the globe to document the achievement. Sadly tragedy stuck in 1932 when his 20-month-old son was kidnapped and tragically murdered in what was called, 'the Crime of the Century.' In the society's own words, the globe is 'a priceless and unique symbol of humanity's unquenchable drive to explore the universe.' A crowning glory of the AGS institution, the globe would not have always seemed as out of place. The society was created in 1851 following Sir John Franklin's\u00a0disappearance\u00a0on his Arctic mission. A group of\u00a0like-minded explorers banded together to create a rescue mission, and thus, the AGS was born. New Zealand explorer, Sir Edmund Hillary, became the first climber to reach the summit of Mount Everest, (left), and\u00a0Charles Lindberg who made the first solo transatlantic airplane flight in 1927, (right). Both explorers are featured on the globe . Amelia Earhart stands June 14, 1928 in front of her bi-plane called 'Friendship' in Newfoundland. She inked her name on the prized artefact .

Despite the mission being\u00a0unsuccessful the AGS grew in popularity, with scholars, businessmen and government officials joining the ranks, at its then office, a celebrated neo-classical building in Washington Heights, to discuss latest geographic news. Unlike rivals, National Geographic Society, who focused on photography and popular geography, the New York based society placed its efforts on sponsoring expeditions, geographic research and education. The society was the\u00a0principal\u00a0map resource for the United States for decades, and at its peak had a permanent\u00a0staff force of over 80, contractually making maps for the government. Government revenues died down after the war, and with the AGS losing a lot of donations, the headquarters were sold in 1970.

It is strange that the globe, arguably the most fascinating in the world, is hidden away with nobody to witness the journey of\u00a0Wiley Post, who in 1933 was the first to fly around the world, or\u00a0Robert Peary, the first man to the North and South Pole. Current executive director, John Konarski III, said: 'It sits in my office and no one sees it. I'd like to get it into the public.' The society is facing a revival, with plans to relocate back to Manhattan, to the redeveloping South Street Seaport neighborhood, poignantly close to where the Finley would first ask explorers to leave their ink mark on history. Wiley Post,\u00a0first pilot to fly solo around the world, inked his route on the AGS's globe .

        "document": "Not many people were more excited for the first day of spring - weather in sync or not - than Jillian Tenen. The 29-year-old events planner moved to Boston from Florida two years ago and doesn't have any family in town. When the first of many record-breaking snowfalls dumped down on the city in January, Tenen was sick with the flu, and didn't dig out her 2007 Honda Civic. Only the snow didn't stop, and the street plows only pushed more mounds in and around where her car was parked in Bay Village. By the time Tenen got her shovel out, it was all-but too late. 'I'm 5' 2,' and it was all ice, an iceberg on top of my car,' Tenen told The Boston Globe. 'I couldn't reach it. I couldn't lift it. And even if I could, there was nowhere to put it. I just didn't know what to do.' After a few laughs, quite a lot of tears, and at lease one breakdown, Tenen realized she had no choice but to abandon her car until winter passed. It's under the iceberg: Jillian Tenen was sick with the flu during the first big snow of winter in Boston in winter, and after failing to dig out her car, it ended up under this mountain of snow on Isabella Street in the Bay Village neighborhood . There it is: Recently, some of the 'iceberg' began to clear and the car - or at least its shape - became a little more clear . Not again: But with this winter being Boston's snowiest ever, the heavens kept opening and the car kept getting buried . Bleak:\u00a0Jillian Tenen's car is seen parked on Isabella Street in Boston on February 23, 2015.\u00a0Winter 2015 yielded the largest record snowfall in the city of Boston's history . Clearing up:\u00a0Jillian Tenen's car went through weeks of storms and melting snow, staying frozen in place at the same on-street parking spot . Almost there: By last week - March 12 - and after two months almost, the Honda Civic was almost ready to escape its cave . Finally!: On March 16, Jillian Tenen's was finally back on the road, seven weeks after it was first snowed in . Yay! All-smiles, Jillian Tenen finally got behind the wheel of her car on March 18, and was shocked that it started right away . But after seven weeks, and a heap of chipping, the car has finally freed from its icy cave. Sadly not much could be done about the damage. The windscreen buckled under the weight of the snow and is all smashed up. There were also deep dents in the roof. But, surprisingly, the car started on the first go after it had thawed. Tenen said her insurance company will now assess the damage. While she hopes that future winters won't be so severe, and will plow her car diligently from now on, she learnt a valuable lesson. 'If I had to do it again, I would definitely do one thing differently,' she told The Globe. 'I would not park on the corner.' Although the storm didn't cripple Boston as previous storms have, it still created a nuisance for snow-weary residents . Damage: The weight of the snow and ice smashed the windscreen and dented the roof quite badly, but Tenen is filing an insurance claim . Many people in the northeastern US had to put on winter boots as Winter Storm Ultima hijacked the first official day of spring . The Brooklyn Bridge was coated with snow as New York City was hit with yet another snowstorm on Friday, March 20 . Brooklyn residents had to bundle up and deal with the cold even though Friday was the first day of spring . Spring arrived on Friday, but Winter Storm Ultima ensured that winter would have at least one more go around with snow . Snow will continue to fall in some parts of the country throughout the weekend . Winter Storm Ultima may have cause more issues for\u00a0Tenen and her car on Friday. Although the storm didn't cripple the city as previous storms have, it still created a nuisance for snow-weary Boston. In the city, it's par for the course to pick up another 3 to 4 inches of snow after March 20, Weather.com\u00a0reported. During the April Fools' Blizzard of 1997, 25.4 inches of snow in just 24 hours paralyzed Boston. On Friday, Ultima led to some travel advisories and early school dismissals . Weather.com meteorologist Jon Erdman said: 'While late March surface temperatures and Ultima's quick movement won't make this a blockbuster, some fairly impressive snowfall rates today will likely lead to at least a slushy afternoon commute in parts of the New York City and Philadelphia metros. The storm dumped 7.3 inches of snow in Lynnport, Pennsylvania, 6.7 inches at McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey and six inches in Cascade, Maryland.",

        "document": "Racing is usually a serious business for the royal family but at Ascot today, Prince Charles was met  a  sight so comical it triggered a fit of giggles. He and Camilla, Duchess of Cambridge, joined onlookers at the Lamb National, in which agile Herdwick sheep hurtle around a specially-built course, leaping over special jumps on a grassy course. The event, which was part of the Prince's Countryside Fund Raceday, clearly tickled Charles who was forced to cover his face as he roared with  laughter at the farm animals' antics. Scroll down for video . Prince Charles catches sight of the sheep hurtling over jumps at the Lamb National in Ascot . The royal soon gets the giggles as the Duchess of Cambridge laughs along with him . Perhaps it was the sight of the sheep's cuddly toy 'jockeys' that made the prince roar with laughter? Camilla laughed along with him, clearly enjoying the sight of the  sheep clad in their multi-coloured coats hurtling around the course. And each one had a little  'rider', a cuddly toy dressed a jockey's uniform, holding on to the sheep's reins . The couple were flanked by Conde Nast president Nicholas Coleridge and Conservative MP Nicholas Soames, who looked equally amused by the fluffy runners. Charles has an added interest in the race as he's patron of the Campaign for Wool (which sponsored the event), a initiative he launched  to raise awareness of British wool in fashion, interiors and industry. Prince Charles stood next to Conde Nast president Nicholas Coleridge (far left), who is chairman of the royal's Campaign For Wool initiative, while Camilla was joined by an equally excited Sir Nicholas Soames . Hopelessly giggling, Prince Charles covers his face while Camilla laughs along next to him . The royal roars with laughter at the sight of the Herdwick sheep hurtling over the little jumps . The royal sees something particularly amusing as he stands ringside at the Lamb National . The  sheep were running along the specifically designed course to win a place in the Winners' Enclosure . While on a blustery spring day, Camilla found herself battling the wind which threatened to blow off her\u00a0beige velvet and fur hat away. Clutching her headgear with both leather gloved hands, Camilla, who looked elegant in a tweed coat with velvet trim, a silk scarf and knee-high brown suede boots, found her coat whipped open. And as the rain fell, she opened up her clear umbrella as protection against the elements. The couple, who recently returned from a tour of the US, seemed delighted by the rural display and as well as the sheep, the pair marvelled at stalls displaying traditional English wares such as slabs for dry stone walling. The Prince of Wales cheers the sheep competing in the race designed to raise awareness of his Campaign For Wool group to raise awareness of British wool . Camilla does battle with the wind, which whipped up her tweed coat, and holds her hat firmly on her head with two hands (left); at another point in the day she put her her clear umbrella against the rain . Ant and Dec wear matching three-piece grey suits to pose with a new equine friend at the Prince's Countryside Fund Raceday at Ascot . There was the 'Quack Pack', duck herding display and a Gold Bunny Easter hunt where anyone spotting a flash of gold bunny ears or hearing a bell ring will have found a clue. Meanwhile Ferret World offered visitors information and the chance to meet these furry animals. Added to the day were saddle and wool-making displays. Charles and Camilla also visited the Heritage Harvest stand to meet people helping farmers grow heritage cereals for thatching straw and grain. Any money raised from the day goes to the Prince's Countryside Fund, which supports rural areas in Britain. And and Dec attended the event, and took part in a live Q&A with fans. Charles discusses the ancient art of dry stone walling with craftsmen at the Prince's Countryside Fund Raceday at Ascot . He also met the team from Heritage Harvest helping farmers grow crops for thatching and making bread . But later as the horse racing began, Camilla had her turn to shout with excitement as the runners stampeded by. Peering at the course through his binoculars, Charles watched the race and Camilla clutched her fist in excitement. The royals also presented jockey Tony McCoy with a framed print on his last race at Ascot in the Waitrose Novices' Handicap Steeple Chase. The pair watch the racing with great interest, with Charles using a pair of binoculars to get a closer look .

        "document": "It rather summed up a week when he made headlines for all the wrong reasons that Rory McIlroy should find the water twice on the 18th hole at the WGC-Cadillac Championship at Doral on Sunday. On American television over the weekend it was impossible to escape footage of him tossing his three iron into the water on Friday. Before the start of play, Donald Trump, preposterous owner of this overrated venue, had presented McIlroy with the said club, after it was retrieved by a scuba diver. How typical of Trump that he plans to have the club mounted in the hotel, thereby glorifying an action that would have every regular golfer drummed out of their club if they tried it. Rory McIlroy hits a shot from the ninth fairway during the final roudn att the WGC-Cadillac Championship . McIlroy's round was shaping up nicely before his unfortunate finish on the 18th hole . The World No 1 tries to play his way out of trouble during a disappointing final round at Doral . McIlroy himself is keen to put the incident behind him and did his best with a round that was shaping up nicely until an unfortunate finish. He stood on the 18th tee tied for sixth but put his drive into the water on this brutal hole and then, after adding a penalty shot, his third shot as well. At least he didn\u2019t lose his sense of humour. He feigned to throw another club in the drink, but this time held on to it. Through the back of the green in five, McIlroy was facing a difficult chip down the slope and staring down the barrel of an ugly triple or worse. Typical Rory. He chipped it in to the end the tournament with a more characteristic demonstration of his usual swagger. The resultant double bogey meant he signed for a 71. He still finished in the top 10, though. All those missed putts, shots and water adventures therefore, and still only a handful of players beat him. Among the leaders, it was hard not to feel sorry for American JB Holmes. He began with a five-stroke lead but got his choke in early. Bubba Watson plays a shot out of a bunker on the 11th hole at\u00a0Trump National Doral Blue Monster Course . There was a seven-shot swing in the first seven holes between him and Bubba Watson, leaving the Masters champion with a two-shot advantage. Watson, however, then dropped a couple of shots himself. With eight holes to play there was a three-way tie for the lead involving these two and fellow big hitter Dustin Johnson. One of the best rounds came from England\u2019s Danny Willett, who shot 68. The 27-year-old, early leader of the Race to Dubai, is getting more comfortable at this rarefied level, and this was a fine confidence boost ahead of his first appearance at The Masters next month. The resultant top-15 finish boosted his world ranking and, as a member of the top 50, assured him of a first appearance in a regular PGA Tour event at the Arnold Palmer Invitational in 10 days. He will also play the Houston Open before Augusta. Dustin Johnson winds up a shot on the 10th hole during a strong final round for the American . \u2018I\u2019m obviously very pleased,\u2019 he said. \u2018It\u2019s a tough course and the set-up is very difficult so to finish on level par for the week, I\u2019d have bitten your hand off if you\u2019d offered me that on Thursday. When you\u2019re playing with the top 50 you know they\u2019re not going to give you anything, but I\u2019m feeling more comfortable all the time.\u2019 How far can he go? One area of concern remains a chronic back injury that has caused him to withdraw from plenty of tournaments over the years and one this year already. \u2018I\u2019m taking painkillers and managing it,\u2019 he said. \u2018I\u2019m going to stay over here through the Masters because flying back and forth is no good for it. There\u2019s no point worrying about it, I\u2019ve just got to get on with it.\u2019 He is doing that all right.",

        "document": "Peter Moores is adamant Alastair Cook has recovered from losing the one-day captaincy and is ready to lead England forward in a run of 17 Tests in under a year. Cook was devastated to be axed from 50-over cricket on the brink of his first World Cup and has watched as England have struggled to improve without him under new captain Eoin Morgan. Yet Moores says his relationship with Cook is undamaged and they have been busy planning for their imminent three-Test series against the West Indies. England coach Peter Moores talks with Alex Hales during an England nets session in Adelaide on Saturday . 'I've spoken to Alastair quite a bit and he's in a good place,' said the England coach ahead of the do or die World Cup match against Bangladesh. 'He's outside of this and is able to plan for Test cricket. 'Our working relationship hasn't changed. He's been an international for a long time and he realises it's a tough business and things change. He's thrown his focus totally into the big Test cricket to come.' That Caribbean series follows this World Cup and begins a year of Test cricket that includes a home series against New Zealand and another Ashes before visits to the UAE to face Pakistan and then South Africa. Alastair Cook (left) was devastated to be axed from 50-over cricket on the brink of his first World Cup . Moores admitted that national selector James Whitaker has spoken to Jonathan Trott about a possible return to the Test side. England may face a West Indies side without Chris Gayle \u2014 expected to retire from international cricket after this World Cup \u2014 and many of their best players could take part in the Indian Premier League instead. England will therefore consider resting players because they have so much important cricket ahead of them, not least the establishing of what will have to be a new one-day side. Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad \u2014 prime candidates to be protected from burn-out \u2014 will both resist any attempts to force them to rest. National selector James Whitaker has spoken to Jonathan Trott (above) about a possible return to Test cricket . Anderson is four wickets away from overtaking Sir Ian Botham as England's leading Test wicket-taker and wants his family to join him for the first Test in Antigua in the hope he will reach the landmark there. Meanwhile, Moores on Sunday insisted he had no regrets about returning as England coach despite the huge pressure which comes with a poor showing at the World Cup. 'No regrets at all,' said Moores. 'I felt I could make a difference. We know we've been behind in the one-day format and have to get better.' Moores looks on as Stuart Broad bowls during his side's training session at St Peter's College in Adelaide .",

        "document": "It's a milestone age that many women face with trepidation. However, approaching 50 doesn't appear to be phasing Elizabeth Hurley. Estee Lauder has renewed her contract for the 21st year in a row, she has a lead role in the new (and unapologetically daft) US series The Royals and her swimwear line is selling well in Saks Fifth Avenue and Harrods. It's now nearly 21 years since the British actress, model and businesswoman  was catapulted into the spotlight at the Four Weddings and a Funeral Premiere. Scroll down for video . Looking regal at nearly 50: Elizabeth Hurley, pictured above promoting new US television series The Royals, puts her enduring beauty down to covering herself in moisturiser from a young age . Show-stopper: The Versace dress worn by Elizabeth at the premiere for Four Weddings and a Funeral put her on the front page of every newspaper. She calls the dress 'a landmark dress in fashion history' Just being on Hugh Grant's arm would have garnered headlines enough but famously pouring herself into that revealing black Versace dress saw her steal the entire show, even if she was thereafter constantly referred to as 'Hugh Grant's girlfriend'. Elizabeth tells the Times that the moment was actually less about her and all about the dress: 'It was such a landmark dress in fashion history. Like nothing to do with me. It was the dress.' The black, strappy ensemble, seemingly held together with large gold safety pins, kickstarted her previously quiet career which, two decades on, has seen her try her hand at everything from acting and modelling to owning her own organic food company and designing her own swimwear. Her looks have very much remained flawless despite the ageing process. Still pin thin, there's barely a wrinkle on her, something which she puts down to nothing more than a lifetime of lathering on moisturiser - with at least SPF30 if she's in the sun - and a great diet. If plenty of older female stars have spoken out about ageism against women recently, any obvious discrimination seems to have passed Elizabeth by. She says there are 'a lot of girls who are doing advertising campaigns who are my age or more. It's a very nice time as far as that's concerned.' 'Quite sexy': Elizabeth's new show The Royals sees her play Queen Helena, based on an 'obviously fictitious' royal family living in modern-day London. Joan Collins plays her mother and was handpicked by Elizabeth . Flawless skin (...and plenty of diamonds): The star (pictured left in a recent selfie) says she hasn't experienced ageism in Hollywood and has had her 21-year contract with Estee Lauder renewed . It's hard to believe but exercise has hardly featured 'for years' thanks to a gruelling work regime that means she doesn't find it easy to make time for working out. Her current schedule, she says, sees her picked up at dawn and not home until 8:30pm in the evening. New show The Royals, described as 'obviously fictitious' sees Elizabeth playing the character of Queen Helena reigning over modern-day England, with Joan Collins, who was handpicked by her, playing her mother. She says of the show: 'It's fun, it's a drama - it's not a comedy but it's lighthearted. It's quite sexy.' She admits that her 12-year-old son Damian, born in 2002 to entrepreneur Steve Bing, was privy to some of the racier scenes, having spent part of his school holidays on the set. Father and son: Liz fell pregnant in 2001 by business magnate Steve Bing. Although Mr Bing denied that Damian, now 12, (right) was his child, a DNA test proved otherwise . Taking a sabbatical from relationships: After plenty of romances including a marriage to Arun Nayar, an engagement to Shane Warne and a short friendship with financier David Yarrow, Elizabeth is enjoying a break . Still the one? They've been apart longer than they were together but the lives of Elizabeth and Hugh are still very much entwined with both being godparent to the other one's child. Hugh is pictured above with Elizabeth's son Damian at a fundraising event in 2013 . After a string of high-profile relationships, Elizabeth seems to be settling for the single life as she approaches her fifties. Speaking on The Jonathan Ross show, she said: 'I am single. On sabbatical. I'm busy at the moment, family, work, I'm working more now than I ever have been, no time for love.' Her life is, she readily admits, still entwined with former beau Hugh Grant's. Although the couple have now been apart for longer than they were together, there seems to be few signs of the friendship fading. The actor is godfather to her son Damian, born in 2002 to entrepreneur Steve Bing and she has returned the favour, being godmother to one of Hugh's daughters, Tabitha. She told Jonathan Ross: 'We're best friends. He lives next door to me and he's godfather to my son and I'm godmother to one of his children. 'We've been apart for longer than we were together. We were together for 13 years and then we've been best friends for 15.' When pushed by the television presenter on a possible romantic reunion, she dismissed the idea, saying: 'I don't think that's going to happen...but he's the best friend that anyone could have.' After a brief dalliance with Steve Bing which resulted in a DNA test to prove his paternity of Damian, she married Indian textile heir Arun Nayar in 2007 after a five-year relationship, with a ceremony in the UK and a lavish six-day ceremony in Jodhpur, India. A new episode in the life of Elizabeth: The star has been promoting new E! show The Royals . When the relationship crumbled five years ago, a series of headline-grabbing romances followed including an engagement to Australian cricketer Shane Warne. Her most recent paramour was said to be hedge-fund financier and wildlife photographer Steve Yarrow. It seems, with son Damian, a small herd of pets to nurture including five dogs, chickens, alpacas and piglets, that she already has more than enough affection in her life. 'I am much more country girl than town girl. When I had my son, it got quite difficult in London to get any privacy and so I bought a farm in the country, in Gloucestershire and lived out there for a while and did full-time farming.' The actress has a rather clever way too of filtering out calls to her office too. She's known by close family not as 'Liz' or 'Elizabeth' but an undisclosed moniker. 'No-one calls me Liz or Elizabeth. If someone rings the office and says anything about 'Liz', we know they've never met me.'",

        "document": "A CEO who reportedly died of a heart attack in Venezuela two years ago has been arrested on fraud charges after being captured by the FBI at his remote North Carolina hideout. Jose Lantigua, 62, and his 57-year-old wife, Daphne Simpson, have been jailed on seven Florida insurance fraud charges each after he was arrested on Saturday wearing a brown toupee and a dyed beard. Each count carries a possible 30-year sentence. Just a few years ago, Lantigua's family appeared to be living the American Dream. The Cuban immigrant claimed he had a heroic military career and earned numerous degrees before running a successful furniture business. He owned a Florida beachfront condo and a new home atop a verdant North Carolina mountain. But in 2012, as his Circle K Furniture company slid deeper into debt, those who knew Lantigua said he'd made some odd decisions: he ordered tons of new furniture on the company dime for his family's many homes. Scroll down for video . Jose Lantigua and wife Daphne Wilson celebrating New Year's Eve 2013. Three months later, his family said he died of a heart attack in Venezuela, his body cremated there instead of returned home. He was arrested this weekend on fraud charges in North Carolina . Jose Lantigua, 62, and his 57-year-old wife, Daphne Simpson, have been jailed on seven Florida insurance fraud charges each after he was arrested by federal agents on Saturday in North Carolina . FBI agents execute a search warrant at the Sapphire, North Carolina, home of Jose Lantigua on Monday. Lantigua, a Jacksonville businessman reported dead two years ago in Venezuela, was arrested in North Carolina on Saturday on alleged fraud charges after his life insurance companies filed a lawsuit alleging he was alive and they shouldn't be making payments . He replaced the bookkeeper he'd used for years with a relative. He built a panic room with steel doors inside his North Carolina hideaway. And, prosecutors say, he and his wife began planning his fake death to scam almost $8 million from insurance companies. No matter how the criminal case turns out, his arrest gives a resolute end to a long-running court battle between Lantigua's family and insurance companies that refused to pay off on his life policies because, for many reasons proven right, they didn't think he was dead. 'I've never seen anything quite like (this case),' said Joe Licandro, a Jacksonville prosecutor working the case. 'There was always a suspicion, but they were able to evade authorities as long as he did, and she didn't have any missteps either - until recently.' Lantigua, who had emigrated to the U.S. as a youth, purchased Circle K Furniture in 2008 after claiming to have served more than 20 years as a senior officer in the U.S. Army, where he claimed to have earned the Silver Star, the nation's third-highest military honor for bravery. Jose Antigua with his heavily-pregnant daughter Christina on New Year's Eve 2013 before he allegedly faked his own death. Friends had left messages of condolence to her following her father's reported passing in 2013 . Months after her father's alleged passing, Christina Lantigua posted this picture of them together and friends posted their condolences below. Neither the businessman's daughter or son, Joseph, have been charged with a crime . The Army has not responded to requests for confirmation. He also graduated from Florida International University in 1989 with a degree in computer science, the school said, and claimed degrees in management, mathematics and physics and aerospace engineering from Pepperdine University, Northwestern University and the University of Florida, respectively. UF said he attended the school but did not earn a degree and Northwestern had no record of him. Pepperdine did not immediately respond to a request for confirmation. By the time Lantigua bought Circle K Furniture, it had grown from a few items sold from the corner of an old feed store to two large Jacksonville showrooms offering everything from contemporary to country-style pieces made from logs. Problems surfaced in 2012, when Lantigua told friends and colleagues he'd fallen ill and needed to go to Venezuela to get an experimental treatment not available in the United States. Simpson stood by his side with an expression of worry, people who know the couple said. Records showed they sold their Jacksonville-area condo for $600,000. About this time, Circle K was also developing financial problems. No one suspected anything suspicious at first, said Kathleen Leis, who was Circle K's bookkeeper. But as the company's debt grew into hundreds of thousands of dollars, she said Lantigua kept buying furniture for his family with company funds. Still, she trusted the man, whose kindness she said she leaned on previously when she had problems. Then Lantigua replaced her as bookkeeper with his sister-in-law. 'I wasn't given a reason except I was needed more on the floor and his sister-in-law couldn't sell furniture,' she said. Before long, Lantigua headed to Venezuela to deal with his alleged illness. Lantigua ran the once successful Circle K furniture company (pictured) but the business began to slide into debt in 2010 . Lantigua, 62, and his 57-year-old wife, Daphne Simpson, are jailed on seven Florida insurance fraud charges each after he was arrested by federal agents on Saturday in North Carolina . It was there, in April 2013, that his family said he died of a heart attack, his body cremated there instead of returned home. Circle K's stores closed a month later and the company soon filed for bankruptcy. Lantigua's family began filing life insurance claims for the nearly $8 million in policies he'd obtained. At his June 2013 memorial service at High Point Community Church in suburban Jacksonville, Lantigua's daughter, Christina, sang 'Amazing Grace' and the pastor read words of hope as his widow looked on. Meanwhile, American General Life Companies had suspicions about the $2 million claim Lantigua's son, Joseph, had filed, particularly the Venezuelan death and cremation certificates accompanying it. First, the physician who signed Lantigua's death certificate never received or examined the body. The investigators also said there had been no autopsy. Finally, the crematorium that had supposedly been used was 250 miles from where Lantigua supposedly died. Investigators found that suspicious. 'The insured's body was purportedly not prepared in any way prior to the cremation and likely would have rapidly decomposed during the lengthy travel in high temperatures,' American General said in court documents. The crematorium representative who signed the certificate was paid to generate false documents, the company said. Last November, American General denied the claim and lawsuits were filed. Joseph Lantigua has not responded to several phone messages  seeking comment. No contact information for Christina Lantigua could be found. Neither has been charged with a crime. American General's findings piqued the interest of local and federal prosecutors, who opened an investigation that included surveillance. At the time of his supposed death, Lantigua and his wife had been building a home at the top of a steep, narrow road on Hogback Mountain in North Carolina, a remote vacation destination near Asheville. 'It's possible that he's been hiding out there these past couple of years,' said Licandro, the Jacksonville prosecutor. Residents of the nearby village of Sapphire said the area is perfect for hiding out: only a couple hundred people live there and they keep to themselves. But Lantigua apparently thought trouble was coming. He built a bunker in his basement complete with 20-inch thick steel doors, said a contractor who worked on the house. 'It made me wonder why would you need a panic (room) here? There's not that many people around here you got to worry about,' said Forrest Boutte, 28. Boutte said Lantigua was a nice, straightforward man. On Saturday, U.S. State Department security agents arrested Lantigua near the Hogback Mountain home. The passport he had used to get back into the U.S. had proved his downfall. The man whose name Lantigua was trying to steal was black \u2014 the photo Lantigua submitted showed he is white. The Social Security number he used was from a woman born in 1917. Suspicious, State Department agents used facial recognition software to discover his true identity. Finding him wasn't hard \u2014 while the other information on his passport application was allegedly forged, he listed his supposed widow as his emergency contact and gave the correct North Carolina address. For those who knew him, the news that he was still alive was startling. 'I'm just shocked. He didn't seem that type at all. He seemed to me an upstanding, Christian family man. He was nice to everybody and wanted help people,' Leis said. It was there, in April 2013, that his family said he died of a heart attack, his body cremated there instead of returned home (pictured) At the time of his supposed death, Lantigua and his wife had been building a home at the top of a steep, narrow road on Hogback Mountain in North Carolina, a remote vacation destination near Asheville .",

Pacquiao: 'I'd like to thank God for providing us a wonderful day and giving us strength. 'For the fans of boxing, I believe, this is what you are waiting for since five years ago. Both of us are going to undergo hard training for this fight and we will do our best on May 2 to make you happy. 'I want to let the people know that God can raise someone from nothing to something - and that is me. I came from nothing to something and I owe everything to God. ' I want to thank all the Flippino fans who are watching at home. I want to thank Freddie Roach for being very nice to me and Bob Arum. We have been working since 2001 and we have loyalty and are the longest working pair in boxing. ' Freddie Roach: 'This is the biggest challenge of my life and I've been looking forward to this for a long time. We are in the toughest fight of our lives, we are fighting the best fighter in the world... but we are going to kick his ass.' Bob Arum and Stephen Espinoza joking about who is the biggest draw in boxing. Espinoza: 'Mayweather is the No 1 pay-per-view-draw in boxing' Arum: 'Everybody has there own opinion, Steven' The man who signed the \u00a3200m six-deal Show Time fight with Mayweather, says: 'Floyd is fighting an opponent many thought he would never fight.' Stephen Espinoza says Tyson-Lewis, Mayweather-Canelo did not generate anywhere near the excitement that Mayweather-Pacquiao has done so far. He says that Pacquiao has been always been high on Mayweather's list and that the first fight didn't happen in 2009 because of the infamous drug-testing clause. Bob Arum talking about the importance of this fight - which he says the whole world will be watching. He says 'it is a credit to the sport of boxing' that this fight is happening. A lot of back-patting between here as everyone congratulates each other on getting this fight done. And the official time is in: 38 seconds Mayweather and Pacquiao stood face-to-face. Mayweather now walking on to the stage to join Pacquiao... and he's walking out to 'We Will Rock You' It is Pacquiao to come first on to the stage... Ladies and Gentleman, boys and girls, let's get ready to rumble. After all the talk and hype, finally the two fighters are about to come on stage. Apparently, Mayweather made \u00a32,500 in his first pro-fight when he beat Roberto Apodaca. On May 2 he will earn a little bit more than that. No wonder he is smiling... The reel of highlights continues, with the audience now treated to Pacquiao's dominant performance against Oscar De La Hoya in 2008 - a fight that turned Pacquiao into a superstar. Ok, now we are back to Mayweather and his unanimous points win over Juan Manual Marques back in 2009. \u00a0The Money man knocked down his opponent in the second round and dominated the fight from start to end. Ok, now it is the turn to relive one of Pacquiao's greatest moments. His destruction of Miguel Cotto in 2009. As we wait for the fighters, we are treated to re-run of Mayweather's 2001 fight with Diego Corrales and specifically the seventh round, when Floyd knocked down his opponent three times in a fight he would go to win with a TKO in round 10. Ken Hersham, the head of HBO, who will also be showing the fight in the States, says this fight will 'transcend boxing' and that May 2 'will be very special' and worth the wait. Let's hope so... Stephen Espinoza, the head of Show Time, who will be showing the fight in the States, says he knew the fight would happen when Mayweather and Pacquaio meet at the Miami Heat basketball game and cleared the air. As we get nearer to the press conference kicking off, tension in the arena in L.A is growing. The pair's previous fights are being shown to the audience. Stayed tuned as we wait for the boxers to get on the stage. AS we gear up for the press conference - which is about to start in a matter of minutes - the red carpet is packed with media, fans and boxing lovers all wanting a piece of Mayweather and Pacquiao. Away from the two star turns, we have some pretty famous boxing faces in attendence - including ring announcers Michael Buffer (left) and Jimmy Lennon . Mayweather is a veteran at these promotional days and is clearly in his element, laughing and joking as he poses for pictures on the red carpet. Not to be out done by Pacquiao, Mayweather has showed up in an equally dapper grey suit. Although the pound-for-pound king has opted to leave the tie at home. Mayweather and his entourage - including two pretty imposing bodyguards - have arrived in Los Angeles for this first and only press conference ahead of the May 2 fight. Stay tuned as the fights are due to come face to face in the next half an hour (if everything runs on time) And the man of the moment, Mr Floyd Mayweather has arrived in Los Angeles. As we wait for Mayweather to make his arrival, here is Pacquiao on why him winning the $300m mega-fight would be 'good for boxing'. READ the full story here. Do you agree? We've got less than 45 minutes until Pacquiao and Mayweather square off... but there is no sign of the pound-for-pound king yet. Stayed tuned because as soon as he shows up, you'll hear it here first. Pacquiao, Arum and Roach are deep in discussion on the red carpet. I wonder if Arum is asking over Pacquiao and Roach plan to stop the undefeated Mayweather on May 2? Pacquiao, as is his way, looks relaxed and calm. May be because his training seems to be going so well. The 36-year-old has been keeping his fans up to date with his progress. Watch his latest video here. Pacquiao has certainly made the effort for today - shades and all! Pacquiao and Roach have been full of confidence ahead of the May 2 fight - maybe it is because they've got a secret sparring partner from Floyd's camp - and they certainly look relaxed as they pose for pictures. First to arrive is Manny Pacquiao, accompanied by his hall of fame trainer Freddie Roach and promoter Bob Arum. And isn't Manny - in his crisp dark suit and purple tie - looking the part. Evening all and welcome to Sportsmail's live coverage of the first - and only - press conference between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquaio. We're due to get underway at 8.30 UK time but excitement is already building ahead of what should be an explosive day in Los Angeles. Stay tuned for all the latest updates, pictures and reaction.",

        "document": "The bereaved parents of a Minnesota teen with a severe dairy allergy who died from eating pancakes are suing the small town diner where he was served them. Cindy Johnson, mother of 16-year-old Scott Johnson, says she asked staff at the Minnesota Nice Cafe in Bemidji if their gluten-free pancakes were also dairy-free during a rare dining-out last June for the teen, who'd suffered from the deadly allergy since birth. Johnson was assured the pancakes were safe and watched as her son ate two of them, reads the complaint. Three days later, Scott would be dead. Assured they were okay: The bereaved parents of a teen with a severe dairy allergy who died last year after eating dairy-laced pancakes are suing the diner that served them to him . Severely allergic: 16-year-old Scott Johnson of\u00a0Bemidji had been to the hospital due to dairy exposure before. His family had learned to be very careful about what and where he ate . 'He had just finished and he said ''we have to go now,\"' Cindy Johnson recalled of the moments after Scott, her second of four children, ingested the fatal breakfast. Scott had suffered allergic reactions before, even from the slightest exposure to dairy. Previous trips to the emergency room had taught his family to be extremely cautious. 'If it wasn\u2019t right, we didn\u2019t eat until his was right,' Scott's father Steve Johnson told WCCO. However, the Johnsons say they were assured by staff at Minnesota Nice that everything would be fine. And it just so happened that Scott had forgotten to bring along his life-saving EpiPen and nebulizer that June day. Cindy rushed her son home. But when they got there, the epinephrine and nebulizer failed to calm Scott's short-circuiting immune system. 'I was eighteen miles off the highway when I got the call,' said Steve Johnson, who was two hours away on a construction job when he learned his son was in dire straits. 'Hardest thing for me was I didn\u2019t even get to talk to him.' Special breakfast: The family didn't normally go out to eat, but Scott's sisters wanted to treat him and their mother one morning last June . Communication failure? According to the complaint, the Minnesota Nice Cafe staff assured Cindy that her son's pancakes contained no dairy. Cindy also maintains she told them the grill would have to be cleaned before Scott's pancakes were cooked on it . Doctors told the Johnsons the dairy exposure had led to anaphylaxis so severe that Scott's heart had stopped. Three days after the family breakfast, Scott died. Now the grieving mother and father are facing massive medical bills and want the Minnesota Nice Diner to take responsibility. 'Just one mistake can take someone\u2019s life,' Cindy Johnson said. The Minnesota Nice Cafe owners are not commenting publicly on the pending case. As the case moves forward, a benefit has been organized for July at which a raffle and auction will be held to benefit the Johnsons financially. Friends of the family have also set up a GoFundMe page, where donations can be made to help the family offset the cost of medical bills. Tragic: Scott had forgotten his lifesaving EpiPen and nebulizer that day in June when his immune system went haywire at the Minnesota Nice Cafe . Cindy rushed her son home, but when they arrived his EpiPen and nebulizer didn't seem to work . 'Hardest thing for me was I didn\u2019t even get to talk to him': Steve Johnson was two hours away at a construction job when he learned his son was being airlifted to a Fargo hospital. Three days later, Scott would be dead .",

        "document": "Jeremy Clarkson, pictured, has been compared to Jimmy Savile by a senior BBC manager in advance of a probe into the latest Top Gear incident . The BBC launched an astonishing attack on Jeremy Clarkson yesterday, comparing him to sex offender Jimmy Savile and urging him to check into rehab. Blaming the now notorious \u2018fracas\u2019 with a Top Gear producer on \u2018personal issues\u2019, one of the most senior Corporation executives said Clarkson was \u2018self-destructing\u2019 and needed help. Most controversially, the TV chief, who has been directly involved in the fallout from the incident, likened Clarkson\u2019s supporters \u2013 including the Prime Minister \u2013 to those who turned a blind eye to Savile\u2019s appalling crimes. Last night, friends of the 54-year-old presenter expressed disbelief that the BBC should make such explosive claims before its internal investigation into the controversy has even begun. \u2018I am in total shock that someone at the BBC would attack their own talent and deliberately smear Jeremy,\u2019 said Perry McCarthy, who was Top Gear\u2019s mysterious test driver The Stig. The broadside came as further details of the alleged assault on producer Oisin Tymon emerged. One report claimed Clarkson split Tymon\u2019s lip with a punch, leaving him needing hospital treatment. Other sources told this newspaper that Clarkson had not been drinking \u2013 and that the row was not entirely about the lack of a hot meal at the end of a day\u2019s filming. But the most astonishing development came during a wide-ranging official briefing given to The Mail on Sunday by a senior BBC figure. The executive likened 36-year-old Tymon\u2019s position to that of Savile\u2019s victims, who feared they would not be believed while he was alive. \u2018The pressure this guy [Tymon] is under is so Savilesque in a way,\u2019 he said, adding that Clarkson\u2019s support from high-level politicians recalled the way Savile was once defended. \u2018If you look at what David Cameron says or what [former Culture and Media Secretary] Maria Miller says and you swap Clarkson for Savile, you get this: David Cameron is effectively saying that Savile\u2019s a real talent, Maria Miller saying Savile will be Savile.\u2019 The comparison will inevitably anger Savile\u2019s victims. Conservative MP Conor Burns, who sits on the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee, said that \u2018it is not just patently absurd, it\u2019s also deeply offensive to Jeremy Clarkson and those innocent people who were horribly abused by Savile\u2019. The BBC executive also said that attempts to suggest the \u2018fracas\u2019 was part of a wider battle between Clarkson and Danny Cohen, the BBC\u2019s powerful director of television, were misleading. Clarkson is said to have a difficult relationship with Cohen, who told him that he was on a final warning after a string of controversies. \u2018People keep saying that this is a case of Danny Cohen v Jeremy Clarkson. It is not,\u2019 said the executive. \u2018This is Jeremy Clarkson v Jeremy Clarkson\u2026 . \u2018Jeremy is self-destructing. Danny is not the person who is driving this, it is Jeremy.\u2019 Referring to the Top Gear host\u2019s much-publicised split from his wife Frances after 21 years, the BBC chief added: \u2018It is common knowledge he has personal issues; we have all read about them. \u2018If I was advising him I would take one of two options. Do what he is doing now and continue to try to play it down \u2013 or I would go into rehab and show the world I am trying to change. \u2018The BBC has stood by him before when he has been in hot water\u2026 But this is more serious.\u2019 BBC Director of Television Danny Cohen, pictured, is said to have a difficult relationship with Jeremy Clarkson . The BBC producer involved in the 'fracas' with Jeremy Clarkson is privately terrified he is going to lose his job, sources claimed. Oisin Tymon has been working on the Top Gear franchise in various roles since 2005 and has also been an assistant producer on BBC One\u2019s The One Show. But the 36-year-old has been in hiding all week, when it emerged he had been punched by the presenter. One insider close to his legal team at Slater and Gordon described Tymon as \u2018mortified\u2019. 'He is terrified that he might lose the job he loves and has been doing for the past six years. All he wants to do is to get back to work,' they told the Sunday Mirror. 'He is mortified by the whole thing.' BBC sources have claimed that Top Gear would survive without Clarkson as other shows \u2013 including Have I Got News For You and Strictly Come Dancing \u2013 have coped with the loss of a much-loved presenter. They added about Tymon: 'We would hope he will continue to be employed by the BBC after this matter is resolved.' Clarkson is being represented by law firm Olswang, which refused to comment. As the row intensified, sources in the Clarkson camp gave The Mail on Sunday what they say is the most definitive account yet of the events leading to the hotel incident. Contrary to what has been widely reported, they insisted the presenter had not been drinking beforehand \u2013 although co-presenter James May downed a bottle of white wine. Neither did Clarkson explode with anger at the hotel just because he couldn\u2019t have an expensive steak. \u2018Yes, it is true that there was no supper but he was angry because they didn\u2019t have enough producers during the day and it made filming extremely difficult,\u2019 said one source. Others close to the star \u2013 who has been suspended by the BBC \u2013 accurately predicted the Corporation would cast him as a man careering \u2018off the rails\u2019. Even so, the depth of the attack, and the personal nature of the comments, will surprise many \u2013 especially as, until now, the Corporation has been careful to limit its comments ahead of the inquiry. The executive\u2019s comments drew a furious reaction from Clarkson supporters. Perry McCarthy added: \u2018This will be a nightmare for Jeremy and he will feel deeply concerned that someone at the Corporation has spoken his name in the same sentence as that disgusting creature Jimmy Savile. \u2018It is ill-conceived, as was the decision to suspend him and take Top Gear off the air. Jeremy is a brilliant broadcaster and a fantastic guy. \u2018It\u2019s atrocious that these idiots at the BBC are paid so much money but run it about as well as a three-year-old child.\u2019 Clarkson is accused of punching TV producer Oisin Tymon, pictured, after a day's filming in Yorkshire . Clarkson, May and Richard Hammond had been filming in Surrey all day before the incident. They left at just after 6pm for a two-and-half-hour helicopter flight to the luxury Simonstone Hall hotel in the Yorkshire Dales. On board, May drank a bottle of wine, but Clarkson drank nothing as he had to work on a script later that evening. A senior BBC source has reportedly told people that Clarkson's much publicised split from his wife Frances, left, could be behind his melt-down . Filming had been fraught because of the shortage of producers and Clarkson was tired, annoyed and hungry, having had nothing to eat all day, the sources say. And it was against this background, that they arrived at the hotel to be told there was no hot supper. What happened next will have to be established by the BBC\u2019s inquiry. It is not thought that Clarkson will dispute ranting at Tymon. But he is already said to deny calling him a \u2018lazy Irish ****\u2019. One account will claim the presenter went nose-to-nose with Tymon and said: \u2018You\u2019ll be on the dole tomorrow. \u2018I\u2019m going to make sure you will not have a job.\u2019 The executive who briefed The Mail on Sunday said: \u2018 [Tymon] could be in hospital because of this. \u2018He is watching it all play out. Jeremy is a bit more used to it. I don\u2019t think Jeremy has got the most to lose. \u2018He has got the money to see him out through his days if he needs to. The other guy [Tymon] is just a jobbing producer.\u2019 Insiders say the BBC \u2013 which holds the rights to the lucrative Top Gear format \u2013 is prepared to continue making the show even if it means getting a new presenter or presenters. They say other shows, such as Have I Got News For You, survived the departure of a host and there was no reason Top Gear could not do the same. Sources said the BBC remained the best place for a fearless motoring programme, because it was not beholden to advertisers. Yesterday Clarkson looked downcast as he left his West London apartment. He declined to comment but told journalists: \u2018You must be freezing.\u2019 The BBC claims that Top Gear will survive if Jeremy Clarkson, pictured, is no longer involved in the show . The BBC disciplinary panel will be led by Ken MacQuarrie, the head of BBC Scotland, who carried out the investigation into Newsnight\u2019s false expos\u00e9 of Lord McAlpine. Clarkson started the disciplinary process himself when he told his bosses at the BBC about the row. Meanwhile, a petition to reinstate Clarkson has gathered more than 920,000 signatures. The Prime Minister appeared to lend his support when he described Clarkson as a \u2018friend\u2019 and \u2018huge talent\u2019, adding that he hoped the situation could be resolved so his children would not be left \u2018heartbroken\u2019. Clarkson is scheduled to appear alongside May and Hammond at four live shows in Norway later this month. All three presenters\u2019 contracts expire three days after the Norway gigs. The last three episodes of the series have been put on hold. Tonight\u2019s show has been replaced with a documentary about the Red Arrows.",

Fireworks, singing, dancing and music-playing are a constant theme of the celebration. The locals say that everything that is bad is burnt, and reborn fresh for spring. Each neighbourhood of the city is required to produce a 'falla' - a wooden sculpture that is eventually burnt. There are different speculations regarding the origin of the Falles festival. One suggests that the Falles started in the Middle Ages, when artisans disposed of the broken artifacts and pieces of wood they saved during the winter by burning them to celebrate the spring equinox. Valencian carpenters used planks of wood called parots to hang their candles on during the winter, as these were needed to provide light to work by. With the coming of the spring, they were no longer necessary, so they were burned. Over time, and with the intervention of the Church, the date of the burning of these parots was made to coincide with the celebration of the festival of Saint Joseph, the patron saint of carpenters. The timing of the events is fixed and they fall on the same date every year, though there has been discussion about holding some events on the weekend preceding the Falles, to take greater advantage of the tourist potential . The five-day celebration is full of joy, fireworks and singing, although the Offering of the Flowers is a more sombre occasion .

        "document": "Five men are to appear in court this month to face football banning order hearings after a video which showed Chelsea fans being racially abusive to a black on on the Paris Metro went viral. Police said each of the men, who have not been named, have been served a summons and will appear at Waltham Forest Magistrates' Court on March 25 'regarding a police application for football banning orders'. Chelsea fans sparked outrage last month when they were filmed singing racist chants and refusing to let a black man on a train ahead of a Champions League match against Paris St Germain. Scroll down for video . This still shows Chelsea football fans on the Paris Metro pushing a passenger to prevent him from boarding.\u00a0Police said five men will appear in court 'regarding a police application for football banning orders' A Metropolitan Police statement said the summonses were served today and yesterday. Football banning orders are issued by courts following a conviction for a football-related offence after a complaint by the Crown Prosecution Service or a local police force, the Home Office website says. They can last for between three and 10 years. Breaches of the orders can result in a sentence of up to six months in prison. Footage captured by a bystander before Chelsea drew 1-1 with Paris Saint-Germain appeared to show a man being pushed back on to the platform amid chants of 'We're racist, we're racist and that's the way we like it'. The commuter, Souleymane Sylla, 33, (pictured) said later he felt 'truly wounded to the bottom of my heart' The commuter, identified only as 33-year-old Souleymane, said later he felt 'truly wounded to the bottom of my heart'. He said: 'We're in 2015, aren't we, and we're in France. We're in a civilised country and when you are in a civilised country there are certain things you can't do. 'For me, it's a humiliation. I was humiliated in my country. I was humiliated in front of my family, humiliated in front of my mother and father.' The development comes on the day that the two teams meet in the return leg of the tie in London. They will compete for a place in the Champions League quarter-finals at Chelsea's Stamford Bridge stadium tonight. Chelsea FC said previously it was 'appalled' and apologised to the victim, while manager Jose Mourinho said he was 'ashamed' of the fans involved. Five people have also been suspended from Chelsea's Stamford Bridge ground following investigations into the incident. The club has reiterated its promise to ban for life anyone proved to have been involved in the altercation and is helping police in the UK and Paris.

        "document": "The British crew of the new James Bond film triggered an international air safety alert by going on a drunken rampage aboard the official 007 jet. Last night, the producers of the forthcoming Spectre film confirmed that they were investigating the 'intimidatory and frightening' behaviour on board the privately chartered plane flying from Stansted Airport in Essex to Mexico City 11 days ago. The Mail on Sunday can reveal that charter aircraft company Hi Fly sent a damning a report to the Bond film production company Eon that revealed how some of the film's crew: . Scroll down for video . The British crew of the new James Bond film went on a drunken rampage aboard the official 007 jet, pictured  filming  in Mexico city last week - there is no suggestion those pictured were involved in rampage . The report also made clear that the reckless behaviour of some of the film crew, fuelled by excess alcohol, had 'compromised' the safety of the Airbus 330 and had breached international aviation regulations. Last night, a worker at Toluca airport in Mexico City said the mayhem had left the interior of the plane looking like a 'pack of wild animals' had gone through it. The source added that vomit had been left inside the toilet and on the floor outside. The producers of the forthcoming Spectre film, starring Monica Bellucci and Daniel Craig,\u00a0confirmed that they were investigating the 'intimidatory and frightening' behaviour . He also claimed the airline had to bring in a specialist firm to clean the plane at a cost of 20,000 pesos \u2013 about \u00a31,000. The incident will prove embarrassing for Eon, which only yesterday launched a glossy trailer for the new \u00a3190 million movie, which will again star Daniel Craig as 007. About 150 of the film's crew, including cameramen, technicians and stunt men, were on their way to Mexico to film some of the most spectacular action sequences, including one that takes place during Mexico's macabre Day of the Dead festival. It is understood that neither Craig nor any other member of the cast was on board the jet, which landed at Toluca Airport for the two-week shoot on March 18. Hi Fly, which has told Eon that its staff breached the conditions of the charter, will deploy extra security at the airport to ensure that no passengers arrive drunk for the jet's return journey to the UK on Wednesday. The airline has agreed to fly the crew back to Britain only on condition that no alcohol is served or consumed on board. The privately chartered plane (pictured) was flying from Stansted Airport in Essex to Mexico City 11 days ago . Members of the film crew\u00a0removed a safety pin from one of the aircraft's doors - there is no suggestion those pictured were involved in rampage . Eon, led by Michael G. Wilson and his stepsister Barbara Broccoli, have now told staff that the flight will be 'dry'. However, in a twist worthy of the Bond films, it is unclear whether the American watchdog, the Federal Aviation Administration, is investigating the incident. On Friday night, spokeswoman Laura Brown confirmed that the incident was 'under investigation' but declined to comment further after being given a detailed account of the reckless behaviour on the plane. But the following day her colleagues denied any such probe was under way. The FAA has some jurisdiction over international airspace around the US, which could have been passed through by the 007 film crew's flight. A spokesman for Eon last night confirmed it was conducting an internal investigation to find out exactly what had happened. But The Mail on Sunday understands that Wilson and Broccoli read the riot act to staff at a production meeting held shortly after the plane's arrival in Mexico. They have also apologised to horrified air crew members. One source, who asked not to be named, said: 'Michael and Barbara have both made it very clear that this sort of behaviour is unacceptable and should never be allowed to happen again. It is understood that neither Craig (pictured) nor any other member of the cast was on board the jet . Some of the film's crew vomited and urinated in the aisles and verbally abused cabin crew -\u00a0there is no suggestion those pictured were involved in rampage . 'The behaviour of a handful of crew members got out of hand and made things very unpleasant for their fellow passengers. 'Eon has apologised to all the crew members who had to endure this intolerable behaviour.' Airline expert Chris Yates said last night that 'it was entirely possible' that the removal of the safety pin could have caused the door to open. He said: 'The pin is part and parcel of the locking mechanism on the aircraft door. Essentially, if you remove it there is a possibility that you could potentially open the door and decompress the cabin.' However, while the risk was real, he added that in all likelihood the door would have been held shut by the speed of the plane moving through the air. Hi Fly, which is based in Lisbon, leases its 12 Airbuses to governments, companies and individuals. Last night, a spokesman declined to comment on the incident. He said: 'This particular flight from the UK to Mexico was a private charter, not open to the public. We have an obligation towards the privacy rights of our clients and therefore we are unable to comment.' A spokesman for Eon said: 'We are investigating the matter so cannot comment further at this time.' Spectre is the 24th movie in the Bond franchise and co-stars Christoph Waltz, Ralph Fiennes and Monica Bellucci. It is due to open in Britain in November.",

        "document": "Rhiannon Blair was left in tears after her classmates poured lighter fuel over her precious notes and set them ablaze - destroying years of hard work in a few seconds of mindless vandalism . This is the shocking moment a gang of bullies set fire to a schoolgirl's GCSE coursework - before sending her a video of the cruel prank. Rhiannon Blair was left in tears after her classmates poured lighter fuel over her precious notes and set them ablaze - destroying years of hard work. The 15-year-old had not realised the work was missing until she was sent the video by her tormentors - who were suspended for just three days after the act of mindless vandalism. The footage shows the teenage bullies laughing and joking as they poured lighter fluid over the pile of papers on a picnic bench and set it alight. One boy even attempted to fan the flames by spraying it with a deodorant can while another threw in a lighter which eventually caused the notes to explode. A pupil then climbed onto the bench to trample over the cindered books. Police yesterday were investigating after the footage was posted online, but confirmed there had been no arrests so far. Rhiannon said she has been the victim of a campaign of bullying at Easthampstead Park Community School in Bracknell, Berkshire, since last September and\u00a0suffered from anxiety and depression as a result. She now fears the stunt may put her entry to college in jeopardy. She said: 'I was shocked and disgusted when I was sent the video by one of the pupils involved. None of them seems to be sorry for what they have done or show any regret. I am just very upset and tearful that all my hard work has gone to waste. 'I have always wanted to work with children and it is what I had set my heart on doing for the rest of my life. I am not even sure if I can get a place on my course at the college anymore. I can't understand why anyone would do this.' The  teenager, who dreams of a career as a nursery nurse, was just two weeks away from submitting the coursework when the bullies destroyed her work. One of the bullies shouts 'put a lighter on it' as another prepares to set fire to\u00a0Rhiannon's coursework . Two boys reel away as the flaming pile of notes explodes thanks to a lighter that had been thrown on them . Her mother, Debbie Groom, said: 'I am so angry. These pupils have ruined my daughter's life. I would be mortified if that was my child carrying out that sort of behaviour. 'This incident is going to scar Rhiannon for life. She has been very stressed and upset but the reaction to the video being posted online has been amazing - it just shows that people do not like bullies.' Another pupil, 15-year-old Kayleigh Holloway from Hanworth, also had her child development coursework destroyed in the pile. Her uncle Neil Holloway said: 'I am disgusted by what has happened. I don't think the three days suspension given to the children involved was not enough punishment. 'They have all probably seen it as a nice holiday. Even though the school has said her grades won't be affected that is not the answer or what we want to hear. 'Kayleigh was very upset when she found out - she has got enough going on in her life without all of this.' Rihannon's mother Debbie Groom (pictured with Rhiannon's family, L-R: \u00a0aunt Anne Yates, mother Debbie Groom, Rhiannon Blair and her sister Katie Blair) said the incident had scarred her daughter for life . Headteacher Liz Cook said letters had been sent out to everybody involved in the incident and assured the victims that their grades would not be affected. She said: 'The school has investigated the incident at length and its origins were a falling out between girls, property was taken as a spiteful act designed to disrupt the victim's lesson the following day. 'On reflection students have realised this act was a huge error of judgement on their part and have been shocked that their act has attracted a social media storm. 'This has been a steep learning curve for them all. The victims of the theft are also being supported as we make every effort to make sure their hard work and studies are not compromised. 'I hope for our students' sake that we will be able to put this incident behind us.'",

        "document": "Since dazzling Australia on the Miss Universe stage in 2010, Jesinta Campbell has proven she's more than just beauty - she's also got the brains. Appearing on Channel Nine's Today breakfast show on Thursday, the 23-year-old was asked about her views on the imminent executions of Bali Nine ringleaders, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran. The pair have since been moved from Kerobokan Prison after 10 years on death row, to\u00a0Nusakambangan, or 'Death Island', where they will be executed by firing squad. Scroll down for video . 'That's the law': Appearing on Channel Nine's Today breakfast show on Thursday, model Jesinta Campbell was asked about her views on the imminent executions of Bali Nine ringleaders, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran . They were convicted for smuggling heroin into Indonesia from Australia in 2005. 'It's so sad. I mean, watching all the footage play out on the news... it breaks your heart because you can't help but feel for their families and they are two humans at the end of the day,' Jesinta said of the polarising situation. She did however stress that despite being strongly against the death penalty herself, the laws in Indonesia regarding drugs are widely known. 'But, like a lot of Australians believe, at the end of the day unfortunately, Indonesia has these rules and if you break them these are the consequences. 'It's so sad, I do not agree with the death penalty, but that's their law.' Sharing her thoughts: 'It's so sad. I mean, watching all the footage play out on the news... it breaks your heart because you can't help but feel for their families and they are two humans at the end of the day,' Jesinta said of the polarising situation . Jesinta is a regular on Today, offering her intelligent opinions on everything from serious current affairs to light-hearted topics. The likely area on Death Island where Chan and Sukumaran will take their final breaths is called, Nirbaya. Found in the island's remote centre, Nirbaya was also the place where the Bali bombers, Amrozi, Ali Gufron and Imam Samudra were executed in 2008, six years after they carried out the nightclub bombings which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, 38 Indonesians and 27 Britons. On Wednesday, Black Sabbath rocker, Tony Iommi, wrote a letter to Indonesia's President, Joko Widodo to ask for clemency for the Australian pair. The lead guitarist\u00a0wrote a letter to President Joko Widodo to ask for clemency for the Australian pair. 'I appeal to you, as a forgiving man, to take note of their transformation,' Tony Iommi wrote in a letter to President Joko Widodo about the two Australian drug smugglers on death row. 'They are now reformed men who are making a positive difference to the lives of their fellow prisoners. 'For this reason, I would ask that you stop the execution of Andrew and Myuran. 'Please allow them to serve out life sentences where they contribute to the well-being of Indonesia and make good for the error of their previous ways.' Controversial topic: Chan and Sukumaran have since been moved from Kerobokan Prison after 10 years on death row, to Nusakambangan, or 'Death Island', where they will be executed by firing squad . Making the journey: The likely area on Death Island where Chan and Sukumaran will take their final breaths is called, Nirbaya . This comes as Foreign Minister Julie Bishop used parliament to directly plead with the Indonesian president. Ms Bishop told parliament on Wednesday that Indonesian authorities were preparing for the execution of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran. 'On behalf of the parliament, I respectfully ask of the Indonesian president that he spare the lives of these two Australian citizens,' Ms Bishop said. She said she had spoken with the two families on Wednesday morning. 'As you can imagine they are devastated but they are just living day by day,' she said. A plea for clemency was rejected in January but since then the government has been seeking a permanent stay of execution. Ms Bishop said there were grounds for clemency and the government believed there were still legal avenues open to the pair. 'The grounds are that both men have shown immense remorse for their grave crimes and... have undergone an extraordinary rehabilitation'. Social justice: On Wednesday, Black Sabbath rocker, Tony Iommi, wrote a letter to Indonesia's President, Joko Widodo to ask for clemency for the Australian pair . In the Senate, Attorney-General George Brandis said the government had made at least 22 representations to Indonesian officials since January in a bid to save the two men. That included letters and phone calls from Prime Minister Tony Abbott, Ms Bishop and the Australian Federal Police. ASIO chief Duncan Lewis and Attorney-General Department secretary Chris Moraitis had also been sent to Indonesia to plead for the pair. However the Indonesian ambassador has defended his government in a letter responding to a Senate attempt to save the Bali Nine duo. Nadjib Riphat Kesoema\u00a0said the decision not to pardon the pair was very difficult for President Joko Widodo on both a personal and humanitarian level. However, the drug problem had 'blossomed into a national emergency' and required strong law enforcement. 'Most tragically, drugs and their traffickers and producers have denied too many people including children of their right to life,' he wrote. Mr Kesoema said both cases had been granted due process of law and all legal avenues had been pursued. He defended the court's decision to impose the death penalty and said separation of powers meant the government could not meddle in judicial processes. The upper house had argued the sentences should be commuted to a prison term due to the pair's genuine remorse and rehabilitation. Chan and Sukumaran were transferred to Nusakambangan island on Wednesday to await their execution.",

MIX FM DJ Chrissie, who is currently the favourite to take out the crown on the channel 10 show I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here, has been in the South African jungle for the past six weeks, leaving her three children in Australia with their father\u00a0Chris Saville.

Resplendent in a crimson ensemble, 43-year-old Maxima donned protective glasses and watched from a wharf in Hamburg alongside her husband. Perhaps not finding the eclipse quite as dramatic as she had hoped, the Argentina-born royal soon began laughing and whipped off her glasses. Scroll down for video . Watching the eclipse: The Netherlands' Queen Maxima and King Willem-Alexander watch the eclipse . Looking good: Maxima looked wonderful in a bright crimson ensemble, complete with matching gloves . Impressed: King Willem-Alexander appeared impressed with what he saw, pointing up towards the eclipse . The Dutch royal couple are currently in the middle of a brief 48-hour tour of northern Germany with Schleswig-Holstein and Hamburg on their itinerary. In Britain, millions turned out to watch the first solar eclipse of this century, which plunged parts of the UK in to brief darkness. Britain's skies began to darken at around 8.24am this morning as the Moon started to move between us and the sun, with the eclipse peaking at around 9.30am across the country. Today's eclipse produced a 100-mile-wide 'totality' shadow path that crossed the North Atlantic, resulting in a partial eclipse across the northern hemisphere, including the whole of Europe, Greenland, Newfoundland, northern Africa and western Asia. Is that it? A less enamoured Maxima took off her glasses early and turned away . On tour: The Dutch royals are touring Hamburg today as part of a brief 48-hour tour of northern Germany . Meeting: They are attending a meeting aimed at boosting Dutch business and trade links . Gas: The royal couple are also being shown a new barge that is fitted out to carry liquefied natural gas . Maxima and Willem-Alexander arrived Germany yesterday, after completing a short three-day tour of Denmark. Having waved goodbye to their Danish hosts at Copenhagen's Kastrup Airport, they flew on to L\u00fcbeck where they were greeted by excited well-wishers clutching hand-painted portraits.

        "document": "Robert Durst's lawyer has dismissed his clients apparent confession during the final seconds of HBO's The Jinx docudrama and said the unguarded comments could be interpreted in a 100 different ways. The six part series concluded last Sunday with the eccentric millionaire off camera talking to himself in a bathroom with his wireless microphone still live. 'There it is. You're caught. Killed them all. Of course,' Durst was heard to mumble to himself. Scroll down for video . HBO's six part docudrama concluded last Sunday with eccentric millionaire Durst off camera talking to himself in a bathroom with his wireless microphone still live . Durst was heard to mumble to himself 'killed them all, of course' in an unguarded moment off camera featured at the end of the final episode of HBO's The Jinx . Durst was arrested by police in New Orleans just hours before the show was broadcast and has since been charged with murder in the December 2000 shooting death of Susan Berman. There is speculation that Durst's explosive comments could be used against him in court, but attorney Dick DeGuerin said they prove nothing. 'There's one hundred ways of interpreting it ... one of 'em being very Shakespearean. The soliloquy,' he told 48 Hours. Famously used by Shakespeare in a number of his plays, a soliloquy is an act of speaking one's thoughts aloud when by oneself or regardless of any hearers. For instance Hamlet's 'To be or not to be' speech. 'If you are a student of Shakespeare, as I am, you'll understand that what I'm talking about,' said DeGuerin. He said he first heard Durst's recorded comments 'along with the rest of America' when it was broadcast last Sunday. Dick DeGuerin, the lead attorney on Durst's team, has compared his client's apparant confession to a Shakespearean soliloquy and claims that it could be interpreted in a hundred different ways . The lawyer also said that it is well know that Durst talks to himself and 'that's just one of his quirks.' 'There are people who feel like he got set up. ...My daughter's a journalist, and she was outraged at what Jarecki and his producers pulled.' DeGuerin also said he was 'astonished' that Durst was interviewed by Los Angeles prosecutors for three hours without his lawyer present after his arrest last Saturday. 'Bob is not sophisticated, he is intelligent, he's got Asperger's,' said DeGuerin explaining why his client hadn't simply refused to speak until he had his counsil present. DeGuerin filled court papers on Friday in which he claims Durst was illegally arrested on charges that he murdered a woman in California, as well as drug and weapons charges filed in New Orleans. In the papers filed at the State Criminal District Court in New Orleans, Gibbens and DeGuerin asked a magistrate judge to schedule a preliminary hearing so that they can prove that there is no probable cause to keep Durst jailed. They argue that he should be released. 'I think he's an easy target and everybody's piling on. ... They're gonna find nothing,' DeGuerin, the lead attorney on Durst's team, told KTRK-TV. DeGuerin also accused Andrew Jarecki, the director of The Jinx, right, of setting up Robert Durst . 'I think Louisiana and their elected officials want a piece of the publicity pie.' The judge agreed to schedule that hearing during another court appearance by Durst on Monday in New Orleans. The attorneys also asked the judge to order that evidence be preserved from the hotel where Durst was arrested. They are seeking any and all records related to Durst and Everett Ward, the pseudonym Durst used to check into the hotel. The documents blasted the arrest, which the attorneys say was orchestrated 'to coincide with the final episode of the HBO docudrama The Jinx. Durst, a member of a wealthy New York real estate family, was charged with murder in California for the December 2000 shooting death of Susan Berman. Durst's arrest came shortly before the HBO finale about his links to three killings \u2014 that of his first wife, who disappeared in New York in 1982; Berman, the daughter a mobster and a close friend who acted as his spokeswoman after his wife disappeared; and a 71-year-old neighbor in Texas whose dismembered body was found floating in Galveston Bay in 2001. Frail: Durst is on suicide watch at a Louisiana detention center. He is expected to appear in court on Monday . Durst has only ever been tried for the Texas killing, and he was acquitted of murder. Durst waived extradition in New Orleans but he is being held there on charges that he was a felon in possession of a gun and with illegally carrying a weapon with a controlled substance. Court documents say investigators found nearly $43,000 in cash, a gun and a rubber mask that could cover his head and neck in his hotel room when he was arrested. Authorities have also said marijuana was found in the room. However, Durst's attorneys say his previous convictions are not serious enough to merit the gun charge. He has been charged in Los Angeles with first-degree murder in the 2000 killing Susan Berman, the daughter of a mobster and a close friend who acted as his spokeswoman after his wife disappeared in New York in 1982. Durst, 71, who is estranged from a family that has a real estate empire worth an estimated $4 billion, has long denied killing Berman and Kathleen Durst, who was declared dead even though her body was never found. Investigators had reopened that case and planned to speak with Berman when she was shot once in the back of her head at her home near Beverly Hills. After the killing, Durst disguised himself as a mute woman and moved into a cheap Galveston, Texas, boarding house where he killed an elderly neighbor in 2001. He claimed self-defense and was acquitted of murder but was convicted of unlawfully disposing of the man's body, which was found chopped up and floating in Galveston Bay. While legal experts said Durst's remarks off-camera and to filmmakers during the production will most likely be admissible, prosecutors will have to decide if they outweigh the possibility that the defense would play other portions of interviews showing him denying any killing. 'I would see this moment of unguarded truth as worth a lot of those denials,' said George Fisher, a former prosecutor and professor at Stanford Law School. 'The flat out meaning of the statement is very clear on its face.' In the case of Blake, prosecutors sought to introduce a portion of a jailhouse interview of the actor discussing his family with Barbara Walters because it contradicted other evidence. The defense then successfully pushed to bring in the rest of the interview. 'It did a great deal both to humanize him and so he wasn't just seen as a celebrity,' said M. Gerald Schwartzbach, who won Blake's acquittal on a murder charge involving the killing of his wife. 'There was an image projected that a lot of people had about Robert as a difficult person. In this video, he came across as a very sympathetic person.' Prosecutors are not commenting on the Berman case while Durst is still held in Louisiana, where he also faces firearms charges.",

        "document": "An epileptic hospital patient was forced to sleep on the floor for four weeks while he was waiting to have a scan on his brain. Michael Collins was kept in a receiving ward, normally for short stays of no more than two days, after being admitted to the Royal Infirmary in Glasgow. He hit his head during an epileptic seizure, making him prone to violent outbursts - so hospital staff removed his bed from the room and made him sleep on a mattress on the floor. It took three weeks before Mr Collins, 54, was given a chair, and though he has now moved to another hospital he is still waiting for an MRI scan six weeks after the accident. Hospital: Michael Collins had to spend four weeks in a room without a bed while waiting for a scan . Relatives of the former roofer, from Glasgow, are desperate to find out what is wrong with him, but until he has the scan - which will take around 45 minutes - they are still in the dark. His partner Suzanne Brown, 50, said: 'We took him to A&E at the Royal and he was kept in overnight. 'He had another fit the next morning so they kept him in for another few days. But a couple of days later he walked out of the hospital at 3.30am. 'He threw all his medication away and walked out dressed only in his slippers, pyjamas and housecoat. 'Clearly, mentally he was not right. Before he banged his head he was fine. He had no mental health issues whatsoever.' Precaution: Mr Collins had to sleep on a mattress on the floor after he behaved violently . Waiting: He did not even get a chair in the room for his first three weeks in hospital . Ms Brown initially took Mr Collins to the GP after he hit his head, and was then referred to A&E. 'We waited seven hours in casualty,' she said. 'Then he was put in a receiving ward. You are supposed to be there for a maximum of two days. 'He was supposed to be going to the Southern to get an MRI scan and a lumbar puncture but they cancelled his appointments three times. 'They're sedating him because of his outburst in the waiting room but he's not that kind of man. It's terrible to see him like this. 'I know there is something wrong with his brain. If they would just give him the scan we could find out what is the matter with him. 'I thought they would at least have given him a bed with cot sides so he couldn't get out or do himself an injury. A&E: Mr Collins spent four weeks at the Glasgow Royal Infirmary, pictured, before moving to another hospital . 'When he went in at first he was quite violent, throwing things about, so they took everything out of his room. 'He keeps going back to when he was a boy and still thinks his mum and dad are alive.' Ms Brown praised the way doctors and nurses looked after Mr Collins before he was moved to the Southern General Hospital, but criticised the NHS for failing to treat him promptly. A spokesman for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said: 'The patient presented with extremely challenging behaviour and for his own protection and personal safety had to be nursed with only a mattress in his room. 'We accept there were delays in transferring him to the Southern General. We also accept a delay in providing the appropriate tests which need to be undertaken with specialist clinical input. 'These have now been arranged to be undertaken this week.'",

        "document": "Michael Clarke hit a supreme 74 as the departing Australian captain led his country to World Cup glory against New Zealand with a seven-wicket victory in Melbourne on Sunday. A crowd of 93,013 witnessed Australia claim their fifth world title as a match that promised so much ended up being incredibly one-sided. New Zealand were always looking for a miracle after being bowled out for a below-par 183 in 45 overs, despite 83 from Grant Elliott \u2013 as Mitchell Starc bowled Brendon McCullum for a duck in the first over.

Australia's players sprint on to the field after beating rivals New Zealand by seven wickets at Melbourne Cricket Ground . Australia captain Michael Clarke (right) shakes hands with Brendon McCullum after being dismissed for 74 . New Zealand's players look dejected after their disappointing innings cost them the chance of glory in Melbourne . In response, Clarke and Steve Smith shared a 112-run third-wicket partnership as Australia cruised to victory in 34 overs. McCullum called right at the toss and on a sun-bathed Melbourne Cricket Ground the New Zealand captain understandably chose to bat. So often the 33-year-old\u2019s own innings sets the tempo of the Black Caps innings and on Sunday it was no different. Having come out swinging and twice been beaten, McCullum was bowled for a duck by a full, in-swinging Starc delivery that cannoned into off-stump. It sent the MCG crowd into a fit of delirium as a wicket fell in the first over in a World Cup final for the first time ever. Aggressive starts to matches with the bat has seen New Zealand boast an average run-rate of 7.70 in first 10 overs of their innings during this tournament but Australia\u2019s early stranglehold on their opposition saw them make just 31 for one. Clarke\u2019s inspired bowling change provided the next breakthrough as the impressive Glenn Maxwell bowled Martin Guptill (15) with just his second ball. And six balls later New Zealand were reduced to 39 for three as Kane Williamson departed for 12 having attempted to block the explosive Johnson but only succeeded in sending the ball straight back to the bowler. It was the perfect start for Australia and Clarke remained on the attack with two new New Zealand batsman at the crease. But Ross Taylor and semi-final hero Elliott steadied the ship and slowly began to rebuild, with the latter top-edging Starc for a 72-meter six into the leg side. The pair shared a 111-run fourth-wicket partnership and looked to have brought New Zealand back into the match only for the batting powerplay to spark a dramatic collapse. James Faulkner, who is quickly becoming one of the best powerplay and death bowlers, was brought back into the attack and immediately had Taylor caught behind for 40. The 24-year-old Tasmanian deceived the batsman with a slower ball and Brad Haddin took an exceptional low catch, diving to his right, with the ball dying on him. Two balls later the heavy-hitting Corey Anderson was sent back to the pavilion having failed to score as he was beaten for pace as the ball came back off his pads and shattered the stumps. A double-wicket maiden in a World Cup is impressive, a double-wicket maiden in a powerplay to induce a collapse is sensational and looked to be the potential match-winning moment. Five out quickly became six as wicketkeeper Luke Ronchi\u2019s time at the crease lasted just six minutes as he edged Starc to Michael Clarke at first slip for a four-ball duck \u2013 the first two overs of the powerplay accounting for three wickets and just a single run. Meanwhile, Elliott \u2013 fresh from his semi-final match-winning unbeaten 84 - continued to time the ball sweetly as all those around him played as if they had never picked up a bat before.

Australia's Steve Smith attempts an acrobatic catch after a shot from New Zealand's Grant Elliott . And, whereas Clarke\u2019s one-day international swansong was going to plan Daniel Vettori could only muster nine before a full in-swinging yorker from Johnson hit the 36-year-old\u2019s pad and rattled onto the stumps. New Zealand were crumbling and Elliott having effortlessly moved to 83 became Faulkner\u2019s third victim of the afternoon as he mistimed his shot and an outside edge was gleefully taken by Haddin. When needed most, the Black Caps tail failed to wag and the final wicket run-out perfectly summed up both side\u2019s days up to that point. Boult defended a short Johnson ball to Maxwell at short leg and in a single move the allrounder picked up the ball and hit the non-striker\u2019s stumps. Tim Southee\u2019s bat stuck in the ground and he was run-out, as New Zealand stumbled to 183 all out. It was telling that Australia leaked just 12 fours and three sixes against such a fierce and deep batting line-up and added further proof of their remarkable day in the field. Early wickets were going to be vital if New Zealand were going to make their first World Cup final they have featured in competitive and their best bowler, Boult, delivered.

New Zealand's Ross Taylor is left on the turf after dropping a potential catch following a shot from Warner . New Zealand's Grant Elliott bats on his way to 83 - the highest score by any player during the Black Caps' innings . Both Australia and New Zealand stand for the national anthems at a packed Melbourne Cricket Ground on Sunday . Aaron Finch attempting to push a fuller ball off his legs only succeeded in hitting the ball into his pads, up into the air and into the waiting Boult\u2019s hands. The Kiwi fans, silent for large parts of the first innings, were now making themselves heard but David Warner soon quieted them once again. Warner found the boundary seven times in his 45 off 46-balls before Matt Henry claimed his first wicket of the World Cup having batsman caught at deep square leg, attempting to pull the ball. The loss of the second Australian wicket put McCullum back into an aggressive mindset and Clarke was welcomed to the field with seven catchers and only one man outside the 30-yard circle. But the right-handed batsman was equal to the task and having passed fifty he smacked Southee for four successive fours before chopping on a slower ball from Henry, having made 74 off 72-balls. And, Smith (56 not out) hit his fifth consecutive half-century as the MCG erupted in jubilation as the celebrations begun. It was a disappointing end for New Zealand who had been brilliant with the bat and ball and in the field throughout the World Cup. But the day and night belonged to the Australians who once again were crowned as the best one-day team in the world.",

        "document": "Chile's president went to a hospital Saturday to meet with a 14-year-old girl who shocked the country by going on YouTube to plead for the leader to let doctors euthanize her because she is tired of her struggle with cystic fibrosis. The government quickly said no after the video began spreading on social media Thursday. A government statement said President Michelle Bachelet talked with Valentina Maureira and her father for more than an hour at the Catholic University hospital in the capital. Scroll down for video . President Michelle Bachelet, right, poses for a selfie with Valentina Maureira, who suffers from cystic fibrosis, at a hospital in Santiago, Chile . Officials did not release any information on what was said. But the government provided photographs of the visit, including one of Valentina taking a selfie with the president, who is also a pediatrician. Valentina grabbed attention after posting on YouTube a video that appeared to have been shot from a hospital bed. 'I urgently request to speak to the president because I'm tired of living with this illness,' said the teenager, whose older brother died at age 6 from the same disease. 'I want her approval so I can get a shot that will make me sleep forever.' Maureira, a 14-year girl who suffers cystic fibrosis and asked the Government for permission to die through a YouTube video, at the Clinic Hospital of Catholic University of Santiago de Chile . Cystic fibrosis damages multiple organs, especially the lungs, by causing recurrent infections that damage tissue. Valentina said she was frustrated by the lack of options and by how the disease had hurt her quality of life. On Thursday, presidential spokesman Alvaro Elizalde expressed sympathy for Valentina's plight, but stressed that Chilean law does not allow euthanasia. 'It's impossible not to be overcome by emotion with the girl's request; it's impossible to grant her wish,' Elizalde said. Chile's government on Thursday rejected a plea from 14-year-old Valentina Maureira (above) to be euthanized . In an interview with The Associated Press on Thursday, the girl's father, Fredy Maureira, said he supported his daughter's request, though he added that he 'cried through the night' after he first heard about her wish to die. 'This is so tough, but I have to respect her decision because she's the one who's suffering this illness,' Maureira said. Shortly after her video picked up attention online the Chile government rejected her plea. Presidential spokesman Alvaro Elizalde said Thursday that although 'it's impossible not to be overcome by emotion with the girl's request, it's impossible to grant her wish,' because it's not allowed under Chilean law. Elizalde said the health ministry was in contact with Maureira's family and was providing her psychological assistance as well as medical treatment. In a statement issued by the hospital, Castillo said she had been transferred out of the critical pediatric patient unit. 'Right now our therapeutic efforts are aimed at the recovery of her nutritional state and supporting her family,' he said. Scroll down for video . Maurerira suffers from cystic fibrosis, and watched her older brother die from the disease when he was just 6-years-old . Valentina's father said she will continue trying to meet with Bachelet, so the president, who is also a pediatrician, can 'listen to her life story.' 'This is so tough, but I have to respect her decision because she's the one who's suffering this illness,' said Fredy Maureira. 'I already lost a 6-year-old son because I didn't have enough money and organs. Now my daughter just wants to die in a dignified way,' he added. Maureira said that after he first heard his daughter's wish to die, he 'cried through the night.' The degenerative disease is affecting Valentina's liver, pancreas and lung, and she has said that she's frustrated by the lack of options and how much it has affected her quality of life. 'She's exhausted, we're all exhausted, but if she wants to keep fighting, I'll be by her side every second,' the father said. 'My message to all the parents in the world who have healthy kids is: Please take care of them. Love them.'",

        "document": "(CNN)Under harsh lights in a private, rented room in Berlin, women face each other in violent, sometimes bloody battles of brute strength. There are no official rules to this female fight club. The fighters are both beginners and professionals, anywhere from age 20 to 50, said photographer Katarzyna Mazur, who spent months documenting the club in 2013 and 2014. Led by founders nicknamed Anna Konda and Red Devil, a match might pit a bodybuilder against a martial arts master. They can wrestle, throw punches or \"cat fight.\" There's no judge, just someone who knows the parameters they've decided for the match. The small audience is mostly made up of men, but it's a place for women to shed the roles they play outside. \"When I saw this kind of fighting for the first time, I was quite shocked. I had never seen something like that before, and it was really interesting to experience all of this so close,\" said Mazur, who photographed the fight club as part of her work toward graduation from photography school. \"Inhibition and fear do not exist on the mat.\" At first, Mazur said, she shot the fight club in color, but the look of the blue mat and neon lights didn't satisfy her. She shifted to black-and-white images and reduced her point of view, getting as close as she could to the action. \"It was not easy to work like that, because the matches were going very quickly and were unpredictable,\" she said, although fighters were respectful and would stop if someone was seriously hurt. \"I had to be very careful not to get hit. Fortunately, there are chairs on the side, so I could jump on them if the female fighters suddenly rolled under my feet.\" For all the aggression built into fighting, Mazur said, the project required a lot of sensitivity. She had to work quickly, and she didn't always know her subjects well. The bouts, the motivations, the scene can all leave a lot of room for interpretation. Mazur said she had to examine her own limitations, questioning \"How far can I go? Do they trust me? Am I allowed to do that?\" Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. \"I enjoy exploring new worlds, especially a world which exists in a gray area,\" she said. She also had to remember that the fighters pushing and pummeling inside the club have lives outside, too -- they're mothers, partners, friends. Their actions on the mat might contradict how they live the rest of their lives. Even years later, the fight club is still running and is \"better than ever,\" Mazur said. \"Very often, I was very moved after seeing and editing the pictures, realizing what exactly happened there,\" Mazur said. \"It is important to always remember my role as a photographer and to always approach the subject with interest and (an open mind).\" Katarzyna Mazur is a Polish photographer based in Berlin.

She has just been crowned Best Weather Reporter for the seventh time \u2013 so there is no doubt Carol Kirkwood is a hit with viewers. But the 52-year-old BBC Breakfast presenter has revealed some male fans are more than a little enthusiastic and send her explicit pictures in the post. \u2018I do get letters from older men, fan mail,\u2019 she said, gesturing to her nether regions. \u2018It is terrible. I have had so many over the years. I am almost immune to it. You can tell by the hand writing. \u2018I don\u2019t have anyone who checks our mail as it all comes into the office. I don\u2019t count them.\u2019 Her smiley demeanour and shapely figure, which she often dresses in figure-hugging outfits, have attracted an army of admirers. On Tuesday she was given the Weather Reporter gong at the Television and Radio Industries Club (TRIC) Awards for the seventh time, beating off ITV rival Laura Tobin and the BBC\u2019s Tomasz Schafernaker. Speaking at the awards ceremony, the presenter \u2013 who also does weather reports for The One Show \u2013 said she also receives sordid messages online. \u2018You get a lot on social media. If they are on Twitter you block them,\u2019 she said. She explained any explicit pictures sent to the office are quickly \u2018binned\u2019. The weather presenter is divorced from Jimmy Kirkwood, her husband of 25 years. But her new partner, whose identity is unknown, takes her legions of male admirers in his stride. She said: \u2018My boyfriend is used to it. He just thinks it is funny. He does not take it seriously which is probably just as well.\u2019 The broadcaster herself has taken a light-hearted approach to live TV slip-ups. Last year she battled on despite accidently \u2018clicking her clicker\u2019 twice, revealing scorching temperatures of 99 degrees in a place identified as \u2018Town name\u2019. Speaking about her live gaffes, Mrs Kirkwood explained: \u2018We can\u2019t see the weather map behind us. Sometimes the map and town doesn\u2019t pop up behind me and that has happened numerous times. You just have to get on with it.\u2019 The glamorous weather presenter said she receives fan mail from enthusiastic older men who would send the explicit pictures in the post . And is seems some viewers have very high expectations of her capabilities. \u2018People do blame me for bad weather, definitely,\u2019 she revealed. \u2018And also people\u2019s expectations are high. People wanted to see snow this year. Some parts saw snow but by no means everywhere.\u2019 She believes women of her age have a lot to bring to the profession. \u2018More and more we are seeing women my kind of age and possibly older coming through the ranks to present the weather. It is good as we offer a load of experience,\u2019 she said. Speaking at the awards ceremony, the presenter \u2013 who also does weather reports for The One Show \u2013 said she also receives sordid messages online . On Tuesday she was given the Weather Reporter gong at the Television and Radio Industries Club (TRIC) Awards for the seventh time, beating off ITV rival Laura Tobin (right) and the BBC\u2019s Tomasz Schafernaker (left) And, although she thinks BBC Breakfast presenter Bill Turnbull, 59, would not make the cut as a weather presenter, she believes multitasking men can be just as good at the job. She revealed: \u2018Bill Turnbull has tried to do it but he is more like a ballerina. When you present the weather it is like tapping your head and rubbing your tummy at the same time. 'If you can do it whether you are a man or a woman, then you can do it. We have got brilliant weather men as much as we have weather women. I don\u2019t know if one is better than the other.\u2019",

        "document": "A mother has revealed her horror after she discovered she married a paedophile. Mel Alford, of Exeter, Devon, said she only found out her husband Jonathan's past when he appeared in court to admit grooming an underage girl for sex. The 37-year-old, who has three children, first met the man she knows as JR, in April 2012 through Facebook as she was friends with his older brother. Mel Alford said she had no idea her husband Jonathan was a paedophile until he was in court . Ms Alford said she agreed to go on a date with him after he \u2018kept sending nice messages\u2019. She revealed: \u2018We ended up getting engaged in August and brought the wedding forward to November that year when I found out my dad was dying from cancer. 'We were together most of the time and the start of our marriage was really good. He was great with my kids and treated me like a queen. 'I had no idea what he was really like until a social worker visited me and told me he was on bail for sleeping with an underage girl. 'That girl had come to my children's dad's house and told him and he contacted social services.' Ms Alford said that her husband denied it and pulled up what he told her was the girl's Facebook page which had a message to him saying 'sorry I lied\u2019. Mel - pictured with Jonathan on their wedding day - said he treated her 'like a queen' She said: 'It turns out he had set up a fake account to send that message. 'Myself and the kids believed him so we just carried on. But he became so jealous after we got married and I could not answer the door in case it was a man and he would sleep outside in his car if we had a row. 'In September 2013 I kicked him out. But I didn't know the allegations were true until I saw he was in court.\u2019 At Exeter Crown Court, Jonathan Alford admitted six counts of sexual activity with a child, seven of making or possessing indecent images of children, three of having extreme pornography and one of perverting the course of justice. Alford was also caught with child abuse and bestiality images on his computer and was jailed for seven years and three months in July last year. Ms Alford said she was totally unaware of his charges until he appeared in court and said struggled to believe that the man she loved and brought into her family was capable of such crimes. Jonathan Alford was jailed for more than seven years after he admitted\u00a0admitted six counts of sexual activity with a child and other related offences . 'I went along to the court and shouted and screamed on every plea. I heard all about his sickening crimes,\u2019 Ms Alford said. 'It was so disturbing I don't think it was really sinking in on the day. 'I walked into the middle of the court and called him a \u201cdirty bastard\u201d. He smiled at me and I just wanted to kill him. 'He had been brought into my family and been around my kids. I was sickened. Still all I know is what I heard in court that day. I still don't really know the full story. 'I never saw him again after that. I wanted to go to his sentencing hearing but because I had kicked off at the previous hearing the police wouldn't let me in. 'I have asked my kids if he ever tried it on with them and they have said no. But he should not have been allowed anywhere near me and my three children while he was on bail. 'There should have been checks done.' Ms Alford said she is now awaiting her final divorce papers to come through, and has set up an unofficial website to \u2018name and shame\u2019 offenders \u2013 which the police have told her to take down. She said: 'It has certainly made me a lot more cautious about people and I am passionate about what I am doing. 'I am proud to have met so many people and victims. I am not a counsellor but they tell me their story and I try and help them.\u2019 She added: 'You have no idea who is a paedophile. I was married to one and did not know. 'I hear so many stories - many of them extremely heart-breaking. I just want people to be more aware of who they are dating and allowing to be around their children.\u2019 She said: 'I carry a lot of guilt that I put my children in danger by having this man around them.

        "document": "(CNN)For those who hoped that the coming presidential election would usher in the dawn of a new, more inspiring politics, this past week has been deeply discouraging. In two key moments, leaders from both sides of the aisle have acted like the Bourbons of France, who famously remembered nothing and forgot nothing from battles of their past. The first and substantively more important moment was the sending of that letter by Republican senators to the Iranian regime. The second, and perhaps more important politically telling moment, was Hillary Clinton's handling of her emails. The two cases are oddly related. In both instances, the principals started with legitimate concerns but have wound up making things worse. In both cases, the principals have also created divisive issues that will deepen polarization through the campaign and probably into the next presidency. Both have diminished the chances for breaking out of today's ugly politics. Republicans in Congress have reason to press hard with their views as negotiations with Iran enter the home stretch. They, like many others -- including a sizable number of Democrats, the current Israeli government, and friendly Arab nations -- fear the Obama administration will cut a weak, leaky deal that will allow Iran to come perilously close to having nuclear weapons. Just as importantly, Republicans believe, with cause, that as he negotiates, President Barack Obama has tried to sideline Congress in general and them in particular. Who can blame them for arguing that if the President insists any agreement needs only executive approval -- not approval by Congress -- then the next chief executive should not be legally bound by its provisions? Their basic concerns were not unreasonable. Thus, if they had sent exactly the same letter to the President, they would have caused a stir but would have been seen as within the norms of politics and statecraft. Instead, they made the mistake -- a wicked one -- of sending it to the terrorist leaders of Iran, leaving a clear impression they were out to sabotage both the deal and the President. We have had renegade members of Congress try to interfere with presidential negotiations in the past -- remember Sen. Jesse Helms? -- but never 47 members of the United States Senate tossing a hand grenade into delicate, life-or-death negotiations conducted by seven major nations and led by the United States. Ayatollah Khamenei made clear this week that he may use the Republican letter as a pretext for rejecting any deal. Where do we go then? Will talks collapse? Will an Iranian rush toward the bomb set off a nuclear arms race, starting in Saudi Arabia, which is already taking preliminary steps? Will the United States then be compelled to use military force against Iran? Who knows for sure? What we do know is that Iran is now almost certain to become a central issue in the 2016 presidential campaign and that the Republican nominee will be under relentless pressure from the right to adopt a hard, unyielding line. One can just imagine a number of GOP candidates pledging that if elected, they will abolish Obamacare on Day 1 and an Iranian agreement on Day 2. This is hardly a way to restore steady, bipartisan foreign policies, as we so badly need. And why have Republicans forgotten so soon the damage done from voters thinking the last GOP president was too hard line and reckless? On the other side of the aisle, Hillary Clinton had absolutely legitimate concerns about the security of emails she might send as secretary of state. As one who spent a year and a half at the Clinton White House and State Department, I could see first hand how they -- more than any president since Nixon -- were hounded by enemies and reporters trying to ferret out secrets to cause trouble or win a prize. It is small wonder that both Clintons still have scar tissue. Hillary Clinton's mistakes did not start with creating an email protection system. No, they started when she and her team failed to coordinate up front with the State Department system and record all official exchanges within the government system on a prompt, air-tight basis. That did not break laws. But it did run afoul of government procedures and, when revealed, naturally gave rise to suspicions about what she might be hiding. In her press conference, she did accomplish her obvious mission: she began cutting legs off the story. In essence, she said one half of her emails (the official ones) are now safely with the State Department and, at her request, will gradually be made public. The other half (who knows what's in there?) have been deleted and she is keeping the server. In effect, she says, they are gone ... and gone forever, beyond Congressional subpoena, FOIA requests, and even hackers. What fresh revelations can the press now pursue? Not many. And how can Republicans browbeat her in hearings without looking like bullies? Hard to do. In short, the story may soon die. You just have to trust me, she says. Clever. But the very fact that instead of inviting a neutral, trusted party like Lee Hamilton to review all the emails, she chose to cut off the story by destroying the evidence comes with a price: she has freshly renewed public doubts whether she plays straight or by her own rules. Loyal Democrats will continue to invest their faith in her, but for many others, the controversy leaves a lingering sense of unease. And polarization deepens. She was always going to face a rough campaign, but now she will begin with clouds already gathering. More to the point, they will obscure her very real strengths as a leader. Around the world, many women look upon her with heartfelt admiration from her years of promoting their empowerment. And she has also has a strong case to make that she and her husband know something about job creation: 22.9 million were created in the eight Clinton years, more than in any other presidency since World War II (Reagan was second at 16.1 million; there have been some 6.4 million in the first six Obama years.). In short, she is worse off than she was before this controversy broke -- and so are American politics. Bill Clinton likes to say that politics is always about tomorrow -- and he is right. But candidates also need to remember and learn from yesterday. After this last week, they might start by reading a wonderful book by historian Barbara Tuchman published some 30 years ago: \"The March of Folly: From Troy to Vietnam.\" There she argues that leaders often start out trying to do the right thing but take a wrong path, stubbornly stick with it despite all evidence and eventually wreck. Tuchman calls their refusal to learn from experience \"wooden-headedness\". We have seen too much wooden-headedness these past days.",

The brothers, aged 16 and 17, raised suspicion when they attempted to pass through customs, Immigration Minister Peter Dutton said on Sunday. \"What we have here are two teenagers who have been intercepted on their way to a potentially very dangerous situation,\" Dutton said. The teenagers had return tickets to unnamed \"conflict zones\" in the Middle East, and a luggage search heightened suspicions that they were headed abroad to fight. The boys were later released into the custody of their parents, who were said to have no idea of their intentions. \"These two young men...are kids, not killers,\" Dutton said, who added the matter had been referred to the  Australian Federal Police. Prime Minister Tony Abbott said the brothers were Australian citizens who had been lured by a \"death cult.\" \"These were two misguided young Australians, Australian born and bred, who went to school here, grew up here, imbibed our values, and yet it seems they had succumbed to the lure of the death cult and they were on the verge of doing something terrible and dangerous.\" The prime minister spoke directly to other susceptible Australians who were considering leaving to fight abroad. \"My message to anyone who is listening to the death cult is block your ears. Don't even begin to think you can leave Australia,\" he added. Australia estimates there are at least 90 citizens fighting and supporting terrorist groups in Iraq and Syria. Last month, the government announced plans to suspend or revoke citizenship for dual nationals involved in terrorism, and also strip certain privileges from Australian citizens who break anti-terror laws.",

And Paul Reiffer's dedication to his work has enabled him to put together a portfolio showcasing the  beauty of some of the world's most famous cities by night. Each of the series of spectacular shots captures the pulsing energy of its location through vivid light trails. Scroll down for video . City snapper, Paul Reiffer, 34, spent over three years amassing the collection of nightscapes, including this of Tower Bridge in London . The winding bridges of Yanan East Interchange in Shanghai are portrayed beautifully in the collection . Reiffer, 34, from Weymouth, Dorset, spent over three years amassing the collection of nightscapes and has visited some of the world's most iconic landmarks in the process. Whether it is the bright lights of the New York City skyline, the winding bridges of Shanghai, or the wispy reflections of Singapore's harbour, each of Paul's photographs reveal a beautiful side to the urban sprawl. By using a specially adapted camera that shoots at a whopping 80 mega pixels per image, the British photographer  is able to capture huge city landscapes in extraordinary detail. Constantly on the move, Paul is continuously travelling in an effort to add new locations to his already impressive portfolio. Then New York city skyline is perhaps one of the more noticeable landscapes from Reiffer's work . Behind the scenes of Pauls shoot in Shanghai; the photographer has spent three years collating his work . Each of the series of spectacular shots captures the pulsing energy of its location through vivid light trails; here the lights of Sydney Harbour reflect in the waters . Paul said: 'Some of my images require a lot of planning, unfortunately, one of the ways I decided to get a different view was to get onto rooftops. 'Some with full permissions and authorised access, others less so. 'Ironically, while legitimate access takes a lot of bureaucracy, it's the more 'unofficial' shoots which take the most planning. 'Generally if you search online, or see a city in a magazine, the same old shots will appear time and time again, so while I use other images for reference, I tend to then start researching using tools like Google satellite view and 3D maps along with sunrise/sunset apps to plan my own take on the view of a city. The serene and still waters reflect the bright lights of Singapore, a hive of activity . A gorgeous sunset of the golden gate bridge, San Francisco reveals a beautiful side to the urban sprawl . The roads may be devoid of traffic here in Kuala Lumpur, but it simply gives the light trails more prominence . 'The shot of the Nanpu Bridge in Shanghai was the most difficult shot to take of the collection, while hanging from helicopters and lying in the middle of roads sounds challenging, photographically this was a real pain. 'Let's just say you need to trust the front half of your feet to get to the place, as that's the only part which will be touching the ledge of a building as you walk along it 30-odd storeys up in the air. The shimmering Auckland skyline in New Zealand looks majestic against the backdrop of the dark waters . The buildings of Kuala Lumpur look palatial, and show off in terrific lighting by Reiffer's camera skills . Reiffer captures the jam-packed nature of New York City from high above most of the buildings . 'I've had to run from some locations with a memory card in my underwear before now! Not because of anything illegal, more an argument with an overzealous security guard on a building I was photographing from. 'Because of the resolution of these images, they can be printed big and when you see a cityscape at two or three meters wide and are able to see every detail of every parked car, building window or landmark in the distance, it's quite impressive.'

The temple put on the incredible feast in celebration of \u2018Dragon Head Raising Day\u2019, which is marked across the country by various traditions that have been passed on down the years, reported the People's Daily Online. Everybody tuck in: The temple in Henan province offered up 'dragon beard' noodles for 2,000 people . Wait your turn: It is considered good luck to eat food named after body parts of the dragon - including 'dragon beard' noodles, 'dragon's ears' dumplings and 'dragon's scales' pancakes . Don't eat it all at once! The noodles are extraordinarily fine and made by hand, while symbolising longevity . Legend has it that on this day the dragon, an important symbol in Chinese culture, will awaken and bring rain to produce a bumper harvest.

Earlier this month, chefs at the White Dragon Temple in Fucheng village used four massive woks to cook noodles for visitors that came from miles around to pray for good fortune and prosperity. Amazingly, all the food was gone within an hour. The feast on \u2018Dragon Head Raising Day\u2019, celebrated on the second day of the second lunar month, is particularly significant because it is believed to ward off diseases. The \u2018dragon beard\u2019 noodles are extraordinarily fine and made by hand. They symbolise longevity, which is why it is unlucky to cut them when you are eating. Just three pounds of wheat flour can be made into 144,000 hair-like noodles, according to experts. When the noodles are made, one rope of dough is stretched up to 12 times to produce thousands of strands. It is reported that some masters of the art are able to make noodles so fine that one strand can be threaded through the eye of a needle. Feast your eyes on this: The White Dragon Temple in Fucheng village used four massive woks to cook . Me first! The feast is seen as particularly significant as it's believed to ward off diseasses .

        "document": "(CNN)A bill that would allow Utah to use firing squads to execute some death-row prisoners passed in the state Senate on Tuesday. The measure, which passed 18 to 10, will be sent to Gov. Gary Herbert, who has not said whether he will sign it into law or veto the bill. Herbert released a statement on the legislation, which would add death by firing squad as an option in a state that uses lethal injection. \"Our statute is clear that lethal injection is the method by which (an execution) will happen. We have no intent to change that,\" he said. The law would give the state the option to use a five-member squad in cases where the drugs necessary for lethal injection aren't available 30 days before the date set for the execution. \"Our state, as is the case with states around the country, is finding it increasingly difficult to obtain the substances required to perform a lethal injection. We are dedicated to pursuing all reasonable and legal options to obtain those substances to make sure that, when required, we are in a position to carry out this very serious sentence by lethal injection,\" the governor said. Eight people are on Utah's death row. Utah banned death by firing squad in 2004, though inmates who chose that option before the law changed still ended up being shot to death. The last execution by firing squad was in 2010, and it was also the most recent execution in Utah. A Utah firing squad also executed Gary Gilmore in 1977, the first death by capital punishment after the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty the prior year. In recent years, states have struggled to maintain a supply of lethal injection drugs as manufacturers either stopped producing the drugs or barred their use in executions. Texas nearly out of execution drug . The European manufacturers of pentobarbital, an anesthetic, explicitly banned U.S. prisons from using its drug in executions. Some states have sought out substitutes or gone with one drug instead of the traditional three-drug cocktail. In April, Oklahoma used midazolam as a substitute for pentobarbital as part of a three-drug cocktail in an execution that went awry. Clayton Lockett, a convicted rapist and murderer, writhed and convulsed after the drugs were administered. It took 43 minutes for him to die. Last week, Georgia postponed an execution because the drugs appeared \"cloudy.\"  The state also indefinitely postponed at least one other execution until it can analyze the cocktail it uses for the procedures, officials said. Georgia halts executions to analyze lethal drug cocktail . CNN's Tony Marco contributed to this report.",

        "document": "Washington (CNN)The Justice Department is preparing to bring criminal corruption charges against Sen. Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, alleging he used his Senate office to push the business interests of a Democratic donor and friend in exchange for gifts. People briefed on the case say Attorney General Eric Holder has signed off on prosecutors' request to proceed with charges, CNN first reported. An announcement could come within weeks.  Prosecutors are under pressure in part because of the statute of limitation on some of the allegations. Menendez told reporters Friday night he has \"always conducted myself appropriately and in accordance with the law.\" He added: \"And I am not going anywhere.\" Menendez said that because of an ongoing investigation he couldn't answer questions at the news conference, held in Newark. The case could pose a high-profile test of the Justice Department's ability to prosecute sitting lawmakers, having already spawned a legal battle over whether key evidence the government has gathered is protected by the Constitution's Speech and Debate clause. The FBI and prosecutors from the Justice Department's public integrity section, have pursued a variety of allegations against Menendez, who has called the probe part of \"smear campaign\" against him. The government's case centers on Menendez's relationship with Salomon Melgen, a Florida ophthalmologist who the senator has called a friend and political supporter. Melgen and his family have been generous donors to the senator and various committees the senator is associated with. RELATED: FBI agents search office of Florida doctor known as Senator's donor . Investigators have focused in part on plane trips Menendez took in 2010 to the Dominican Republic as a guest of Melgen. In 2013, after word of the federal investigation became public, Menendez paid back  Melgen $58,000 for the 2010 plane trips calling his failure to properly disclose the flights an \"oversight.\" Menendez said he has been friends with Melgen for more than 20 years and the two families have spent holidays and other special occasions together. One of the highest ranking Hispanic members of Congress, Menendez is a former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He has become one of the Obama administration's most vocal Democratic opponents on two key foreign policy matters -- President Obama's decision to ease the trade embargo against Cuba and also his effort to engage direct negotiations with Iran over that country's nuclear program. Menendez advocated on Melgen's behalf with federal Medicare administrators who accused Melgen of overbilling the government's healthcare program, according to court documents and people briefed on the probe. Melgen was among the top recipients of Medicare reimbursements in recent years, during a time when he was also a major Democratic donor.  Melgen's attorneys have denied any wrongdoing. Prosecutors also are focusing on whether Menendez broke the law in advocating for Melgen's business interest in a Dominican Republic government contract for a port screening equipment. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency, at the time, considered donating port screening equipment to the Dominican Republic, which would have hurt the contract of Melgen-controlled company. Menendez, now serving his second full term as senator, led the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee from 2009-2011. During a Senate subcommittee hearing in 2012, Menendez didn't mention ICSSI, Melgen's company, by name, but he did press Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Matthew Rooney about an unnamed company who had a contract to X-ray cargo that went through all Dominican ports -- a contract that, he said, Dominican authorities \"don't want to live by.\" \"If those countries can get away with that, they will,\" the senator said. \"And that puts American companies at a tremendous disadvantage.\" Menendez's office said at the time the senator's interest was based on his efforts to combat narcotrafficking in the region. Other lines of inquiry against Menendez had included  allegations he solicited prostitutes in the Dominican Republic, and that he violated the law helping win permanent U.S. residency for two Ecuadorian banking magnates, the Isaias brothers. The prostitution allegations collapsed after the purported prostitutes recanted their story, and the FBI didn't find evidence of wrongdoing in the Isaias matter, according to people briefed on the probe. The FBI probe has already spawned a legal battle between the government, Menendez and his former aides. Last week, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals briefly posted, apparently by accident, documents detailing legal efforts to block certain evidence and testimony the government wants to use. The documents were quickly put back under seal, but not before a reporter with the New Jersey Law Journal secured a copy and later published a story. According to the documents, Menendez's lawyers have sought to claim emails and testimony from aides is protected by the constitutional protections given to members of Congress in carrying out their duties. The speech and debate clause prohibits questioning of members of Congress about \"legislative acts or the motivation for legislative acts.\" The fight centers in part on the Justice Department's attempt to compel testimony from Menendez's aides, some of whom have refused to answer questions to a grand jury. According to the documents, the government wants to question aides about a series of 2012 calls and meetings on Melgen's fight with the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, a federal agency. Among these is a meeting among Mendedez, Sen. Harry Reid and then Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. The government is also pushing to use emails between Menendez's office and a CBP official about the Dominican ports issue. A federal district court ruled in favor of the government to compel testimony from Menendez's aides, but the appeals court reversed the ruling and ordered a hearing. \"The parties primarily dispute the legislative character of Senator Menendez's two conversations with [then acting CMS administrator Marilyn] Tavenner and his meeting with Secretary Sebelius,\" the appeals court said. \"These communications are not manifestly legislative acts because they are informal communications with executive branch officials, one of whom was at the time a presidential nominee whose nomination was pending before the United States senate.\"",

Last year at Ladies' Day at Aintree racecourse, in Liverpool, where one racegoer takes a glug of pink champagne . He warned that any photographer taking unflattering pictures would lose their accreditation. 'We have to absolutely protect that because it's at the core of what we are, and we have a responsibility to our customers to project the correct image,' he told the Liverpool Echo. 'We have talked about trying to monitor those photographers, so if we see any element clearly looking for a negative shot and we can identify that, we will take their accreditation off them and we'll kick them off the site.

        "document": "San Rafael, California (CNN)At 74 years old, Marilyn Price still remembers the first time she rode a bike. \"My father let go of my seat, and there I was on my own,\" she said. Years later, Price realized the power of biking to change lives. During a 1982 mountain biking trip in northern California, Price reached a point on the trail where she could see all of San Francisco. Looking out at the city, she thought of the children she met while volunteering at a soup kitchen there. And it hit her: She wanted to give them the same experience. \"There's nothing like biking up a mountain and looking behind you to see all you've accomplished,\" she said. Price has since helped more than 25,000 at-risk children from the San Francisco Bay Area get off urban streets and into nature through her nonprofit, Trips for Kids. Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for CNN Heroes 2015 . In addition to mountain bike excursions, the group provides bike mechanic training and the chance for young people to earn credit toward their own bikes. Today, Trips for Kids has expanded to 90 chapters around the world, serving more than 15,000 children each year. See more CNN Heroes . CNN's Allie Torgan spoke with Price about the impact of her efforts. Below is an edited version of their conversation. CNN: For many of the young people in your program, this is their first time on a mountain bike. How do they react? Marilyn Price: Many of them have never really left the city. To them, life is automobiles and buildings. Everything is concrete. But you bring them where there are no buildings, no cars, it is like, \"Wow!  I didn't know that this exists.\" I think we're planting a seed that there are alternatives to getting into trouble. They can get on a bike and go to a place that is very much unlike where they live and do something positive. It's giving them the notion that there is something else. CNN: And their experience goes beyond bike trips. What else do you offer? Price: The second is our Earn-a-Bike program, where kids in the community come after school. They learn bike mechanics, and while they're participating they are earning credit. They can use it to buy bikes or parts. They're buying bikes for themselves, for their parents or siblings. I just love the idea of having them work toward a goal. They're really learning skills that will help them in the future. The third (program) is our bike thrift shop, where anyone in the community can come shop for a discounted bike. We call it Trips for Kids Re-Cyclery. All of the bikes and bike gear are donated. It provides 60% of what we need to run our programs. And it is 100% an environmental program. We follow the three 'Rs' very rigorously: reduce, reuse and then recycle! CNN: Trips For Kids has grown well beyond San Francisco. Why do you think this model works so well? Price: It's easy to use the bike to introduce kids to the environment because the bike is universally loved by children. The bike allows us to introduce them to a healthy lifestyle and good work habits. (It's) a tool to impart these life lessons. Right now there are 90 chapters, literally around the world, that are repeating our experiences. They all do bike rides and then some of them, as they get more developed like we did, also start their own Earn-a-Bike programs or their own bike thrift shops to support themselves. CNN: Did you ever imagine your simple idea would have such an impact? Price: I wear my Trips For Kids T-shirt wherever I go. I went into the bank one day here in Marin County, and there was a young girl who was the teller. She looked at my T-shirt, and she said, \"Wow -- you're with Trips For Kids? That was the best experience I've ever had. I will never forget it.\" I don't know how many stories there are like that, but it's planting that seed. I just love every minute of it.\u00a0Seeing the results of what we were accomplishing just had me stick with it.\u00a0Since I started the notion, I haven't given up and hope to continue forever. Want to get involved? Check out the Trips For Kids website at www.tripsforkids.org and see how to help.",

        "document": "A group of pranksters managed to trick more than a dozen art lovers into thinking that a cheap print from IKEA was a valuable work of modern art. Dutch YouTube jokers lifehunterstv took a \u00a37(10 euro) print and placed it in an art museum in Arnhem, and asked visitors what they thought of the 'painting' and how much it could be worth. Several art fans praised the IKEA print, with some valuing it to \u00a31.8million(2.5million euro), before being told of the hoax. Funny guys: A group of Dutch YouTube jokers took a \u00a37 print from IKEA and placed it in the Museum for Modern Art in Arnhem . The team from lifehunterstv placed the cheap canvas on display in the Museum for Modern Art in Arnhem, and asked art lovers for an appraisal. They told visitors the painting was done by famous Swedish artist 'IKE Andrews', and, according to the pranksters, all of the nearly 20 people interviewed bought the lie. The video shows presenter Boris Lange talking about the painting to a number of visitors, who call the cheap print 'modern' and 'shocking'. One man praises the print for its 'constructiveness of things on top of each other, inside each other'. Another  visitor, a man in a flatcap, beard and glasses, claims he can 'clearly see that it concerns a form of symbolism', adding that the artist has a 'beautiful spirit'. Joke: Presenter Boris Lange told visitors the 'painting' was done by famous Swedish artist 'IKE Andrews' and say everyone of the nearly 20 people interviewed bought the lie . A man in a flatcap, beard and glasses, claims he can 'clearly see that it concerns a form of symbolism' When asked how much they believe the artwork to be worth, one guesses 'over 1,000 euro', while another says: 'If you could buy this for 2.5million euros, I'd do it.' 'The whole day everyone thought our \"painting\" amazing,' the team behind the prank says. 'When the people talked about that this image is a symbol of the painters spirit, and that it could be worth a 200,000 euros or even 2.5million euros it made us laugh inside!' When the pranksters told the art fans about their IKEA hoax, a majority saw the funny side, but, lifehunterstv reveals, not all were pleased about being duped. 'The last two guys couldn't even say one word as a reaction and just walked away with red cheeks. We could feel the awkwardness'. Taking it well:\u00a0When the pranksters told the art fans about their IKEA hoax, a majority saw the funny side . Hit a nerve? Two men who had praised the painting were so offended when told that it was a cheap IKEA print that they left without a word . This comes just days after IKEA customers in the Netherlands were stopped from organising a mass-game of hide and seek. A whopping 19,000 people signed up to a Facebook group promoting a game at IKEA's Amsterdam branch next month, and another 13,000 signed up for a game in the Ikea store in the city of Utrecht. But the Swedish retail giant has bad news for folks wanting to hide among its room-like furniture displays: The numbers signing up are getting out of hand and the events have been blocked. 'We have contacted these pages on social media and humbly asked them to have their hide and seek games somewhere else,' IKEA spokeswoman Martina Smedberg said Tuesday. Ms Smedberg added that IKEA does not want to be a spoilsport, but safety comes first.",

        "document": "Arsene Wenger fears Alexis Sanchez is running out of steam and is searching for the right moment to give the \u00a332million Chile striker a well-earned break. Only Per Mertesacker has played more for Arsenal this season than Sanchez, who has played for 3,326 minutes in his debut campaign, scoring 19 goals but only one in his last 11 appearances. 'He's a bit fatigued and in a position where he has scored less,' said boss Wenger. 'He wants to force his game and then is more involved in physical battles. Maybe goalscoring is on his mind, so he wants to do too much and he wants to force his game. Alexis Sanchez has played more minutes this season than every Arsenal player except Per Mertesacker . Manager Arsene Wenger has considered resting the Chile international because he is fatigued . But Wenger concedes the games are too important to leave out his star 19-goal forward . Despite his early-season form the former Barcelona attacker has only netted once in his last 11 games . 'I'm tempted to give him a break at some stage. I have been for a long time. It's not that he won't let me, I will decide that. It's just that every game now is so important, you always have a hesitation to do it.' Arsenal are at Newcastle in the Barclays Premier League on Saturday, and Wenger will expect a reaction after sliding out of the Champions League on Tuesday. The trip to Tyneside may present a good opportunity to rest Sanchez, with plenty of available options, including Tomas Rosicky set to return after illness, and the manager attempting to keep his squad fresh for the FA Cup defence and to finish as high as possible in the Premier League. Sanchez in action as Arsenal crashed out of the Champions Leaguedespite a 2-0 win against Monaco . Sanchez and his team-mates prepare for Saturday's Premier League clash with Newcastle . Wenger believes Arsenal are too far behind league leaders Chelsea to make a late push for the title . Jose Mourinho claimed Arsenal were back in the title race after a two-point swing last weekend, even though they remain seven points behind leaders Chelsea with a game fewer to play. Wenger said: 'At the moment we are too far away from Chelsea, but we have an opportunity every week to get closer and for that we need positive results from us and negative results from Chelsea. I believe Chelsea still has a very good cushion and very good security.'",

        "document": "This is the 12-sided \u00a31 coin that will replace the version that\u2019s been in circulation for more than 30 years in 2017. Experts say the new, bi-metallic coin, which will be in two colours, will be the most secure coin in circulation in the world. The striking design featuring a rose, leek, thistle and shamrock emerging from a Royal Coronet was created by 15-year-old schoolboy David Pearce, who won a Royal Mint competition. Scroll down for video . The new 12-sided \u00a31 coin design that will replace the current version, designed by 15-year-old David Pearce . The current \u00a31 coin has been in circulation since 1983 - much longer than the normal life cycle of a modern British coin. Its technology is said to be no longer suitable for a coin of its value, leaving it vulnerable to ever more sophisticated counterfeiters. More than 6,000 people entered the competition to design the new coin. David Pearce, of Queen Mary\u2019s Grammar School in Walsall, was surprised by a phone call from the Chancellor this week telling him he had won. His design features the four well-known symbols of the UK emerging from a Royal Coronet. The Royal Mint estimates that about three per cent of all \u00a31 coins - or a staggering 45 million - are now forgeries. In some parts of the UK, the figure is as high as six per cent. Over the past few years, around two million counterfeit \u00a31 coins have been removed from circulation each year. George Osborne meeting with children who entered the competition at Number 11 Downing Street yesterday . In a nod to Britain\u2019s heritage, it is the same shape as the 12-sided threepenny or thrupenny bit, which was in circulation from 1937 until decimalisation in 1971 and was in the first group of coins ever to feature the portrait of Queen Elizabeth II. The threepenny bit was the first British coin to use a 12-sided shape, which was popular during the Second World War since its distinctive size and shape made it the easiest coin to recognise during the blackout. The new \u00a31 coin will affect many aspects of daily life, including vending machines, parking meters and shopping trolleys. Ministers admit there will be costs for some businesses, but say the increasing number of forged \u00a31 coins in circulation mean action has become urgently needed. The current \u00a31 coin has been in circulation since 1983. Pictured, annealed coins at the Royal Mint . Many business leaders agree that such significant sums are now being lost through counterfeits that a new coin that is harder to forge is needed. Mr Osborne said: \u2018Designing the new \u00a31 coin was a brilliant opportunity to leave a lasting legacy on what will be the most secure coin in circulation anywhere. \u2018The competition captured the imagination of thousands of people and David Pearce\u2019s winning design will be recognised by millions in the years ahead. 'It was fantastic to congratulate him and other young entrants in person in Downing Street.\u2019 David said: \u2018I was really excited to hear that I had won the competition to design the new \u00a31 coin but hugely shocked as well. \u2018I heard about the competition through my design teacher at school and I thought I had nothing to lose so I decided to enter.

        "document": "They are extraordinary treasure troves, stuffed full of some of the greatest works of art that Britain has ever produced. But the National Trust now wants its stately homes to have fewer exhibits \u2013 because they are too demanding on visitors. The charity, which owns 500 historic homes and gardens, is worried that rooms often have \u2018so much stuff\u2019 it puts off all but the middle classes. The National Trust, which owns 500 historic homes and gardens such as Cliveden House in Buckinghamshire, is worried that exhibitions often have \u2018so much stuff\u2019 it puts off all but the middle classes . In an attempt to try to broaden the appeal of Britain\u2019s grand properties, bosses yesterday launched a ten-year strategy that includes plans to \u2018simplify\u2019 some exhibits. Dame Helen Ghosh, director general of the National Trust, said simplifying the exhibits may be necessary. \u2018We are making visitors work too hard in some places,\u2019 she said . \u2018It\u2019s not surprising given that where we have come from, that the type of places that we own are the places where the middle classes feel more comfortable, that it forms more of their cultural background. \u2018Our analysis is that it isn\u2019t the entrance fee that is putting people off, it is that they think this isn\u2019t \u201cthe place for them\u201d So how do we get them in?\u2019 The Trust's director general\u00a0Dame Helen Ghosh, said places like the\u00a0Carrick-a-Rede bridge attracts visitors from all social classes . Dame Helen, who was Permanent Secretary of the Home Office until she was appointed to the Trust in 2012, said that some properties have a broader appeal. \u2018When you go to somewhere like Carrick-a-Rede in Northern Ireland and watch people walking over the rope bridge, they are from every socio-economic background, wearing shorts, flip flops, all of that,\u2019 she said. But many of the large stately homes have a far narrower visitor base. The Trust is to experiment with simplifying the exhibits at some of its properties. Dame Helen said: \u2018When it comes to our big grand houses one of the things we have to look at is the sheer number of exhibits. There is so much stuff in there. \u2018Let\u2019s not expect our visitors to look at every single picture in a room - let\u2019 s pick one lovely thing, put it in the middle of the room and light it really well. \u2018Let\u2019s just have six or seven of those things dotted around that anybody would love - it\u2019s not difficult. \u2018We make people work fantastically hard - we could make them work much less hard.\u2019 But she denied that the Trust is \u2018dumbing down\u2019 its approach in order to boost visitor numbers. \u2018In many ways it is much more intellectually rewarding,\u2019 Dame Helen insisted. \u2018People will learn much more by looking at one object in a lot of detail, than they ever would going round a room getting a vague impression.\u2019 Tim Parker, chairman of the Trust, added: \u2018Every museum and gallery has the middle class problem. \u2018We have serious aspirations to broaden our appeal - but the worst thing we can possibly do is to semi-condescend a group of people in order to a property seem more attractive.\u2019 The National Trust is also putting a renewed emphasis on the great outdoors in the spirit of its founder Octavia Hill, who campaigned to provide open spaces for the poor. As part of that goal it is working as a consultant body with councils in Sheffield, Manchester and Coventry, to look at new ways to maintain and fund urban parks. The Trust hopes to use its experience in establishing endowments - the funding model that it uses to conserve many of its historic houses - to help set up new funding models for green city spaces. Although the Trust is not putting in any money to the schemes, other charities such as the Heritage Lottery Fund and Nesta are also involved. Mr Parker, a businessman who recently took over as chairman from outspoken journalist Sir Simon Jenkins, said outdoor space is a key way to broaden the Trust\u2019s appeal. \u2018The fantastic opportunity for the Trust is that we are not confined to buildings - we have lots of parks - people don\u2019t have to go inside,\u2019 he said. \u2018We can do lots of things to make the whole offer that we have appeal not just to people who are in their 50s and 40s but people who are in their 20s and 30s as well. It is an age thing, not just a class thing.\u2019",

Their new 2015 RB11 car has been used in F1 testing with a camouflage livery in order to ward off rival teams attempting to copy their design secrets. Red Bull won consecutive Drivers' and Constructors titles between 2010-13 but relinquished their crowns to a dominant Mercedes and Lewis Hamilton last season. Red Bull Racing have tweeted this picture of their 2015 RB11 car with this season's livery, which is back in their usual team colours . The new colour scheme was displayed on the team's Twitter page with the hashtag '#BackInColour' as Red Bull returned to their usual look. The most notable shape change to the 2015 car is the lower nose box and front of the chassis, which were amended in line with the latest regulations. Drivers Daniel Ricciardo and Daniil Kvyat have been putting the camouflaged RB11 through F1 testing in Catalunya but have managed a staggering 397 less laps than reigning champions Mercedes on the track as they look to close the gap. The 2010-13 Constructors champions hope their 2015 RB11 car can help the team reclaim the title off last year's champions Mercedes .

        "document": "It has been a multi-million pound rescue mission lasting 12 years, but 900-year-old Cardigan Castle, in Wales, is set open its doors to visitors once more in April. Tens of thousands of people are expected to flock to the historic castle, to see the results of the\u00a0Cadwgan Building Preservation Trust project. It is set to be a lavish affair, with 3,000 daffodils and 1,700 rolls of turf planted in celebration of the occasion. Cardigan Castle is set to open in April, after an \u00a312m renovation.\u00a0It is hoped that the Castle will become one of west Wales\u2019 top tourist destinations, attracting at least 33,000 visitors in the first year . The castle, which has been unoccupied since 1996, will open its doors to visitors in April, following an extensive \u00a312m restoration project which began in 2011 . The new lease of life for the castle includes the recreation of the paths and lawns of the regency gardens, a  glass restaurant with panoramic views over the River Teifi, and the restoration of the whalebone arch \u2013 a popular feature for early 19th Century gardens. The impressive landmark has a fascinating history, from being build as a wooden Iron Age settlement by Gilbert de Clare in 1100, to enduring medieval battles between Normans and Welsh rebels, and hosting Wales' first Eisteddfod in 1176. The last inhabitant was\u00a0Barbara Wood, who sold the castle in 2001 after residing there for almost 60 years. The redevelopment of the site has included the recreation of the paths and lawns of the Regency gardens and the fitting of a floor-to-ceiling glass restaurant . In 1165, The Lord Rhys and his Welsh army captured the castle and Cardigan became the first town in the country to be occupied by the Welsh . The design of some elements of the stone castle were inspired by the crusades and are the earliest examples of this work in the UK . The summer will feature events including an open-air theatre to music concerts, and fascinating exhibitions which tell the story of Cardigan, the castle, the people who lived there, and its role as the birthplace of the Eisteddfod . The castle was purchased by the council in 2003 and began being repaired as part of the regeneration of Cardigan by the CBPT charity. Jann Tucker, chair of CBPT, who was recently awarded an MBE for her efforts in preserving Welsh heritage, said: 'It's been a long time coming but the finishing post is nearly in sight. We have worked so long and so hard for this. 'The Castle will really put Cardigan on the map.' Through extensive refurbishment, and many hours work from numerous volunteers, the derelict site has been transformed into a high-end heritage attraction, luxury accommodation, restaurant and wedding and events venue. The renovation has transformed the house, previously inhabited by Barbara Wood, and restored the building for guests. Barbara was the last person to live in the castle and moved to the site as a young girl in July 1940 . Situated on raised ground overlooking the River Teifi, the site of Cardigan Castle has been an ideal location for thousands of years. This was confirmed by archaeologists in 2012 when Neolithic flint scrapers were unearthed in the castle\u2019s grounds . Cardigan Castle has seen many battles over the years. A lesser known siege took place in 1138 when the Welsh attacked the Norman base with the help of Viking mercenaries . Cris Tomos, Castle Director, said: 'We're busy putting the finishing touches in place and are looking forward to opening ahead of the May bank holidays and summer school break. 'And there's plenty to attract visitors to the Castle over the summer months, with an exciting programme of events, from open-air theatre to music concerts, and fascinating exhibitions which tell the story of Cardigan, the Castle, the people who lived here, and its role as the birthplace of the Eisteddfod.' Funding for the grand project came from the Heritage Lottery Fund (\u00a36m) and European Regional Development Fund (\u00a34.3m), with the rest provided by other council and heritage trust funds. The grand opening will be\u00a0Wednesday 15 April 2015. The project has seen the site transformed from a derelict building into a high-end heritage attraction, luxury accommodation, restaurant and wedding and events venue .",

The 26-year-old, identified at one point by the dispatcher as Michelle, spoke faintly on the six-minute call: 'She cut me in the stomach... I'm pregnant... I'm bleeding out.' The woman was able to give the dispatcher the address of the home in Longmont, Colorado where she had been attacked, adding that she was in the basement and had locked the door. She has multiple wounds, she said, and that the attacker broke a glass and stabbed her in the neck. The 911 dispatcher pressed her for the attacker's name and the woman responded that she didn't know the assailant and had gone to her home answering a Craigslist ad for baby clothes. She added: 'I was trying to leave.' Dynel Catrece Lane, 34, allegedly stabbed the 26-year-old in the stomach and pulled out the baby, killing the fetus in the process, police said on Thursday. The mother survived the attack. Scroll down for the 911 call . Dynel Catrece Lane, 34, allegedly stabbed the 26-year-old in the stomach and pulled out the baby, killing the fetus in the process. She had lured the victim to her Colorado home using a Craigslist ad for baby clothes . Lane, 34, who is married and has two daughters, was driven to hospital by her husband following the horrific attack where she reportedly told staff she had a miscarriage . According to this online profile, Dynel Lane had registered for baby gifts and boy's clothing and noted her due date as November 14, 2014 . The dispatcher repeatedly reassured the victim that help was on the way and when her voice began to fade away, she urged her: 'You stay with me, don't go to sleep.' Police rushed to the scene and could hear the victim calling for help inside the home. An officer found the victim in the basement. Lane had left the house when police arrived. The victim was taken to Longmont United Hospital where she underwent surgery and is expected to recover. The baby did not survive the attack. Longmont police Cmdr Jeff Satur told Daily Mail Online that the female suspect was taken to hospital by her husband. Lane was reportedly carrying the victim's dead baby and telling hospital staff that she had suffered a miscarriage. The husband is not a suspect, the police chief said. ABC7\u00a0reported that the husband believed his wife had suffered a miscarriage. Police would not comment on whether the suspect had recently been pregnant. Comments on Lane's social media referred to a pregnancy last year. A relative said on Thursday that Lane had lost a child of her own more than a decade ago when he accidentally drowned. Lane's son was 19 months old in 2002, when he drowned in a shallow pond at the home of her parents near Pueblo, Colorado. Investigators at the time ruled the death an accident. Lane and her now ex-husband were devastated by the child's death, said Aaron Cruz, the boy's paternal grandfather. The couple had two daughters together and had been trying for a boy. A July 2002 obituary for Lane's son, Michael Alexander Cruz, in the Pueblo Chieftan said the boy loved playing with his sisters, cousins and friends and had just learn to sing his first song, Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star. Lane's then-husband wasn't home at the time of the drowning, the newspaper reported at the time. She and their two daughters, then five and three, searched for the boy until they found him in the fish pond. He had been playing a game with his sisters while their mother was busy in another part of the house, the newspaper said. Lane also lost her grandmother earlier this month, according to her social media posts. According to social media, Lane had remarried and was assistant manager at a franchise of a company, Once Upon A Child, which buys and sells 'gently-used' children's clothing. KDVR\u00a0reported on Wednesday that a baby registry was set up in Lane's name last year and listed her due date as November 14, 2014. The clothing in the baby registry was for a boy. Public records revealed that Lane held a certified license as a nurse aide which expired in 2012. After speaking to the victim, police were able to arrest Lane at the hospital at 7.46pm on Wednesday. Lane was facing charges of first-degree attempted murder, first-degree assault, and child abuse knowingly and recklessly resulting in death, the Boulder District Attorney's Office confirmed on Thursday. Police are looking for any other mothers who may have responded to Lane's ad for baby clothes. A seven months' pregnant woman had her baby cut from her womb by another woman in a horrific attack which killed the fetus at this home in Longmont, Colorado on Wednesday . Police said the 34-year-old woman who lives at the home stabbed the pregnant woman and 'removed' her baby. An armed officer outside the property in Longmont, Colorado on Wednesday afternoon . Police hoped to gain access to the home on Wednesday night using a search warrant. Investigators said they have an 'idea' of the motive of the attack but were not ready to release it until charges are filed . A man gives information to police near the scene of the horrific attack in Colorado on Wednesday afternoon . Under Colorado law, the charges are complicated by the fact if a child was not  born alive, then homicide charges could not be brought. The Boulder County DA's office does not expect to file charges until next week. Investigators have not released the name of the suspect or the pregnant woman but said they did not know each other. The 26-year-old mother-to-be had gone to the home alone to answer the Craigslist ad in Longmont, a town 30 miles outside Denver. A police officer removed what appears to be an evidence bag from the scene (left). Police planned to search the house on Wednesday night after bringing in a mobile crime scene unit (right) Police entered the suspect's home on Wednesday night after obtaining a search warrant. They hoped the search will better explain what motivated the suspect to engage in such a crazed attack. 'This is a tragic case for a mother right now,' Cmdr Satur told Fox 31 Denver. 'She came by this house. She was attacked, and her baby was removed from her.' The alleged assailant has two daughters, Commander Satur said. Her husband apparently drove her and the fetus to the hospital. Lane is scheduled to appear at the Boulder County Jail at 2pm on Thursday. It was not known whether the victim had any other children.

He said: 'Yeah I do worry about that, I do worry about that. It's a constant battle and it's a constant thing that I've got to just be conscious of to make sure whatever job I'm doing now and in the future, that I make sure that I make sure that there's that time for them. 'I don't want them looking back and thinking, 'well Dad was never around' 'Dad was always on the phone', I think they probably would say Dad is on the phone a lot but I don't want them thinking you know I was just, I was never there.' The Labour leader said that his brother, David, would not be returning to Britain to take part in the general election campaign . David Miliband, who was defeated for the Labour leadership by Ed in 2010, would be concentrating on his job in New York running the International Rescue Committee charity . Ed Miliband revealed what he likes to watch on TV with his wife Justine . Ed Miliband revealed how he tries to keep romance alive with his wife Justine. While David and Samantha Cameron regularly have a night out in London, the Milibands prefer to stay closer to home. 'Nothing we like more than a night in, whether it\u2019s watching a box set or just spending some time together,' Mr Miliband said. 'Well the last thing was, not exactly a box set, Broadchurch two which we really enjoyed.' He revealed he had tried to explain what being a party leader means to the five and four-year-old. 'We've tried, we've sort of had a bit of a discussion about the red team, we're the red team. We've even talked about the debates a bit, what Daniel calls 'the argument about the arguments'.' Mr Miliband revealed how he has even enlisted Daniel into calling for David Cameron to take part in TV debates: 'They do know who David Cameron is, Daniel thought it was very important he turned up to the debate.' The Labour leader said that his brother, David, would not be returning to Britain to take part in the general election campaign. Instead his older sibling - who he defeated for the leadership in 2010 - would be concentrating on his job in New York running the International Rescue Committee charity. 'We had a bruising leadership contest four-and-a-bit years ago, he's moved on from that, I've moved on from that. 'He's got his own thing that he's doing and I think he wants to carry on focusing on that. One of the reasons he left after the leadership contest was because he didn't want the soap opera.' Mr Miliband dismissed the controversy over the disclosure that he has two kitchens in his north London home. 'This election isn't going to be decided by my kitchen or kitchens, it's going to be decided by what's happening to people in their lives,' he said. While he said that he was confident that he would win the general election on May 7, he insisted that he was not yet 'measuring the curtains' for No 10. 'I think that we are going to win the election but I'm not measuring the curtains and I think it's really important we don't do that,' he said.",

        "document": "It brings new meaning to the phrase 'shark attack'. While most people will be familiar with images of seals being violently smashed out of the water snatched in the jaws of a shark, it appears some are exacting their revenge on the ocean predators. Scientists have reported multiple cases of cape fur seals attacking blue sharks off the coast of South Africa. Scroll down for video . Scientists have reported multiple cases of cape fur seals attacking blue sharks and eating their guts off the coast of South Africa. Diver Chris Fallows captured this image.\u00a0The behaviour has left marine biologists baffled as to why the seals have turned to attacking the torpedo-shaped sharks . The seals, which are normally prey for great white sharks, have been seen attacking and killing medium-sized blue sharks, devouring their guts before leaving the rest of the carcass. Divers also report seeing the fur seals attacking other species of shark and rays. The behaviour has left marine biologists baffled as to why the seals, which normally hunt smaller fish, have turned to attacking the torpedo-shaped sharks. The blue sharks are around the same size as the seals and it is thought to be the first time a seal has been seen preying on such a large predator. It was first observed by marine photographer Chris Fallows, who runs a dive boat operation from Cape Town in South Africa. Dr Neil Hammerschlaf, a marine biologist at the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Astmospheric Science who was involved in the study, said the seals appear to be eating the guts of the sharks as they contain the most energy. The blue sharks are around the same size as the seals and it is thought to be the first time a seal has been seen preying on such a large predator. An expert said there are relatively few reports of pinnipeds, or seals, preying on sharks in general, and in all cases these involved smaller sharks . Blue sharks, like the one above, are one of the ocean's top predators with a sleek body and mouth full of teeth.\u00a0Dr Neil Hammerschlaf, a marine biologist at the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Astmospheric Science said the seals appear to be eating the guts of these sharks as they contain the most energy . He said this behaviour may have serious implications for blue sharks, as their numbers are already in decline due to over fishing. 'Seals are generally considered prey of larger sharks,and blue sharks have been observed pursuing juvenile and adult male Cape fur seals, though no kills have been witnessed,' he continued. 'There are relatively few reports of pinnipeds (seals) preying on sharks in general and in all cases these involved smaller sharks. Cape fur seals, like the one pictured, normally use their manoeuverability to prey upon smaller fish and squid.\u00a0Scientists believe that the seals could also be attacking the sharks partly to remove competition for the fish they normally eat . 'The consumption of large sharks by a Cape fur seal is a departure from the prevalent view of this species\u2019 diet, which is generally reported to consist of a diverse diet of small fish species, cephalopods and birds. 'The prevalence of the behaviour reported here is unknown - it could reflect opportunistic predation by a generalist predator or it might be a common tactic. 'These observations are important not just for understanding the interactions between these two species but more broadly for their implications in understanding the trophic ecology of pinnipeds - many populations of which have increased while numerous shark populations have declined.' Length: Males typically grow up to 7.5ft (2.3 metres) Weight: Males weigh 440 to 660lbs (200 to 300kg) Weapons: Large canine teeth, powerful jaws and claws . Normal prey: Mainly fish but also about a fifth of their diet is squid and sometimes crabs . Behaviour: They can live up to 30 years and then to gather in small groups but will often swim alone. They can dive as deep as 200 metres (650 feet) and stay underwater for seven minutes. They are commonly attacked by great white sharks, which attack them from below, and killer whales which hunt them in packs. Length:\u00a0Females grow between 6 to 9.3ft (1.82 to 2.82 metres) Weight: Females weigh 205 to 401lbs (93 to 182kg) Weapons: Multiple rows of triangular serrated teeth . Normal prey: Bony fish,  cuttlefish, octopus, shrimp and crabs . Behaviour: Their sleek body shape makes them fast and efficient swimmers, allowing them to snatch their prey out of the water. Blue sharks live for up to 20 years, are known as an open water species, and often migrate long distances. They are preyed upon by  larger sharks like the great white and tiger shark. Fur seals have been known to mob great white sharks in large numbers but this is thought to be a defensive tactic to scare them away from breeding colonies. In this case the fur seals have been observed attacking the blue sharks, which are open ocean predators that can grow to be about 9ft long (2.82 metres), on their own. Mr Fallows, who runs Apex Expeditions, first noticed the behaviour in 2004 while on a dive off Cape Town. Fur seals are common prey for great white sharks, which snatch them in their jaws from below (above). Fur seals will often group together and mob these sharks, but this is thought to be a defensive tactic . In 2012 he again saw a large Cape fur seal attack five blue sharks from a shoal of ten over a two hour period. The sharks were estimated to measure between 3.6ft (1.1 metres) and 4.5ft (1.4 metres) in length. Mr Fallows said: 'They swim up to them and grab them. There is no protracted chase. 'It is almost as though the sharks are not expecting this to happen and do not overly react to the seals advances. 'We have seen them feeding on three other small species of sharks. We have also observed them feeding on rays. 'I would think it is possibly a learned behaviour based on limited normal food availability.' A study on the behaviour is now published in the\u00a0African Journal of Marine Science. Scientists believe the seals could be attacking the sharks partly to remove competition for the fish they normally eat. Dominic Tollit, a marine mammal consultant with the Sea Mammal Research Unit in Canada, told New Scientist that attacking such a large and heavily armed predator is a high risk strategy if simply looking for food. He said: 'Would you attack a lion if you're hungry, or would you go for something smaller?'",

        "document": "Robert Durst's family is so scared of the suspected-murderer that they have taken out a restraining order against him, even though he is currently behind bars without bail. A New Orleans judge has approved an order of protection, preventing Durst from contacting his brother Douglas, head of family business Durst Corp, and other members of Douglas' family. The former real estate heir was arrested this week on charges related to the murder of his long-time friend Susan Berman, who was killed execution-style in 2000. Prosecutors have charged Durst with capital murder,\u00a0making him eligible for the death penalty if convicted. Scroll down for video . Robert Durst's (left, in mugshot taken Saturday) family has taken out a restraining order against him, in the wake of his recent arrest on murder charges. Durst's brother Douglas pictured on the right in November 2014. In the state of California, murder convicts can only be eligible for the death penalty or life in prison without parole if prosecutors prove that the murder was carried out with a 'special circumstance'. In Durst's case, the alleged special circumstances include killing a witness and lying in wait. Last year, California's death penalty was deemed unconstitutional, but the state will likely appeal the decision. The last time a California death row inmate was executed was in 2006. Durst, 71, was recently the center of HBO documentary The Jinx, and in the final episode which aired Sunday, appears to confess to killing multiple people when he thinks the audio on his microphone is off. But Los Angeles Police say his Saturday arrest has nothing to do with the recording. The latest protective order prohibits Durst from communicating with brother Douglas, his wife Susanne, their children Helena and Alexander, as well as their respective spouses and children. According to documents obtained by TMZ, Durst must stay away from their offices and homes - something he has had difficulty doing in the past. Durst was the recent subject of HBO documentary The Jinx. In the final episode, which aired Sunday, he appears to confess to killing multiple people when he thinks the audio on his microphone is off. LAPD say his arrest on Saturday has nothing to do with the show . In April 2013, Durst was arrested for lurking outside of his brother's house. The Jinx follows Durst's long fued with his younger brother Douglas, who father Seymour named head of the multi-billion-dollar family corporation. In the wake of Durst's arrest, Douglas issued a statement on behalf of the family which reads: 'We are relieved and also grateful to everyone who assisted in the arrest of Robert Durst. We hope he will finally be held accountable for all he has done.' In addition to the death of Susan Berman, Durst has been linked to the disappearance of his wife Kathleen in 1982, and the homicide of his elderly neighbor Morris Black. Durst was acquitted of Black's murder after claiming he killed and then dismembered the neighbor out of self defense. He is currently being held without bond since he is considered a flight risk. Authorities are currently in the process of extraditing Durst from New Orleans to Los Angeles where the most recent charges were filed.",

        "document": "The progress Liverpool have made since that defeat at Old Trafford in December has been nothing short of remarkable. They remain the only unbeaten team in the Barclays Premier League this year and it owes much to the solidity of a defence now boasting six straight away games without conceding a goal. Clearly, it amounts to a tactical triumph for manager Brendan Rodgers. Not least in the way he tore up his own blueprint for life without Luis Suarez and came up with an entirely new strategy that has worked for the players who remain at Anfield. That is no easy task, as Roberto Martinez and Louis van Gaal would probably testify. Simon Mignolet dives to spectacular deny Swansea's Gylfi Sigurdsson during Liverpool's 1-0 win on Monday . Emre Can has slotted in well in defence after Brendan Rodgers changed his system . Brendan Rodgers (left), Colin Pascoe (centre) and Mike Marsh talk tactics on the Liverpool bench . Liverpool have not lost in their last 13 games - a run that has seen them rise from 10th in the table to fifth. Should they beat Swansea on Monday then they will be just two points off fourth place. D - 2-2 Arsenal (H) W - 1-0 Burnley (A) W - 4-1 Swansea (H) D - 2-2 Leicester (H) W - 1-0 Sunderland (A) W - 2-0 Aston Villa (A) W - 2-0 West Ham (H) D - 0-0 Everton (A) W - 3-2 Tottenham (H) W - 2-0 Southampton (A) W - 2-1 Man City (H) W - 2-0 Burnley (H) W - 1-0 Swansea (A) But watching Liverpool at Swansea on Monday night, their success in stopping their hosts from scoring was down to more than the clever deployment of certain players. Yes, there is no doubt the decision to move Emre Can into a back three - when he was signed principally as a midfielder \u2013 was quite brilliant. Can has been superb in the role alongside Martin Skrtel and Mamadou Sakho, who have also benefitted hugely from a tactical reshuffle that appears to provide them with more security and with it greater confidence. The decision to drop Simon Mignolet earlier this season has also proved an astute piece of leadership by Rodgers. How a player responds is of the utmost importance and Liverpool\u2019s goalkeeper, much like we saw with Joe Hart at Manchester City, has returned with greater focus and determination. Against Swansea he made some marvellous saves, in particular to deny Bafetimbi Gomis and Gylfi Sigurdsson. That said, Liverpool\u2019s defence also demonstrated against Swansea that they remain prone to the occasional mistake. There was a moment at The Liberty Stadium, which led to the Mignolet save to deny Gomis, when a neat exchange of passes between Swansea\u2019s French striker and Wayne Routledge left a gaping hole in Liverpool\u2019s back three. In the press box we do not have the benefit of Jamie Carragher and Gary Neville\u2019s tactical analysis but I can imagine one of them might have highlighted that on their super-duper tactics board at half-time. This is where Liverpool have also been riding their luck a little; a luxury teams sometimes enjoy when they have a bit of momentum and something that was illustrated further by the nature of Jordan Henderson\u2019s winning goal. Jordan Henderson (right) scored Liveprool's winning goal after a lucky deflection . But football teams often make their own luck and the truth is their success in defending their own goal in recent weeks goes way beyond good organisation and some fine individual performances. It points to the fact that Liverpool, having started the season so poorly, are working doubly hard to get back into contention for the Champions League places. They are defending as a team, with players tracking back tirelessly from midfield to rescue their colleagues when mistakes are made. Neil Taylor tested Can on Swansea\u2019s left flank but it was Henderson who was there to make one important interception, even if the challenge was a little over-zealous and earned the England midfielder the first yellow card of the night. When Gomis burst past Skrtel later in the game, it was Joe Allen who was there to cut out the shot. Desire and determination are important qualities at this stage of the season and Rodgers declared his side\u2019s ambition to finish second again this season in the knowledge that these players want it every bit as much as he does. VIDEO Monk rues missed chances . Mamadou Sahko (right) puts in a challenge on Jonjo Shelvey as he again impressed for Liverpool . Martin Skrtel (left) is proving himself a leader at the back of a much improved Liverpool defence . Yes, the defenders look more assured. Yes, Skrtel is proving himself a leader in the Liverpool defence. Against Swansea he was outstanding, even producing the initial pass that led to Henderson\u2019s goal. And yes, Sakho and Can are now playing to the level we have long come to expect of Liverpool defenders. But they are working as a team, and playing with more composure after Rodgers realised the more cavalier approach they employed when Suarez and Daniel Sturridge were terrorising defenders just wasn\u2019t working this season. The statistics make interesting reading. Only five Premier League goals conceded in 10 games in 2015 compared to 25 in the 19 they had played before the turn of the year. But it\u2019s as much down to hard graft as the intelligence of Rodgers. And while the deployment of Gerrard as a holding midfielder, and with it a slight change to a diamond formation, gave Henderson the freedom to get further forward last night, it was the mere fact that Henderson was fit enough and determined enough to make that run in pursuit of Sturridge\u2019s flick-on that earned Liverpool their goal. Seriously motivated, Liverpool are on the move again.",

        "document": "PG tips has become the latest big-name brand to quietly shrink its product but not the cost \u2013 in a step likely to infuriate Britain's tea lovers. The pyramid teabags are sold on the basis they contain exactly the right amount of tea for a perfect cuppa. But each one now has had its leaves reduced by 0.2g, meaning a box of 80 regular teabags has come down in weight from 250g to 232g. That is the equivalent of six teabags \u2013 yet the price of the boxes has stayed the same. The change was made so quietly that it seems even supermarkets were caught by surprise. Rip-off: Each PG tips teabag has had its leaves reduced by 0.2g, meaning a box of 80 regular teabags has come down in weight from 250g to 232g . This week, Tesco stores had shelf labels with a price of \u00a31.99 for a box of 80 PG tips at 250g. But the boxes on the shelf were the new version, weighing 232g. The change was spotted by a former buying director for Tesco, Safeway and Nisa, Melvyn Searle, who said: 'I have never seen anything like this in my many years in the grocery trade. 'They have reduced the weight of tea in the teabag but not the number of teabags in the box. 'People are getting less tea and that must reduce its strength. It is very strange. I really feel that customers are being short-changed. 'This is one of the biggest tea brands in the country and people will rightly want to know where their tea has gone.' The lighter teabags have resulted in the weight of other PG tips' boxes coming down, too. A box of 40 is now 116g instead of 125g, the 160 pack is 464g, not 500g, and the 240 carton is 696g, down from 750g. Every day, 165million cups of tea are drunk in the UK. Ninety-six per cent of these are brewed from teabags. This means even a tiny reduction in weight can equate to millions of pounds of savings for manufacturers. But last night PG tips' parent company Unilever said that the weight change was due to a different mix of leaves \u2013 and that the tea still tasted exactly the same. A spokesman explained: 'We've introduced a new blend and new bags whilst ensuring the same great taste of PG tips. Sneaky: The change was made so quietly that it seems even supermarkets were caught by surprise . Spot the difference: This week, Tesco had shelf labels pricing a 250g box of 80 teabags at \ufffd\ufffd1.999 - even though the boxes on the shelves were the new 232g versions . 'Our new blend includes a proportion of leaves that have been pressed to release a natural tea juice. 'This, combined with new paper, complements the blend, ensuring that the brewing time is unaffected and flavour of the blend is as great as it's always been.' The firm said it had tested its new bags with hundreds of customers who were happy with the flavour. But Which? consumer group claimed the change was another example of 'Grocery Shrink Ray'. This is the increasingly popular trend for big-brand manufacturers to shrink their products without offering corresponding cuts in the prices. The net result is a stealth price rise, because customers get less for their money. Other culprits in the last five years have included Cadbury Dairy Milk, which reduced its 140g bar to 120g, Walkers Crisps (34.5g to 32.5g), Mars Bars (58g to 51g), Nestl\u00e9 Munchies (150g to 126g) and Cadbury Creme Egg multi-packs (six eggs down to five). In all cases, the prices remained the same. Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: 'Shrinking products can be a sneaky way of putting up costs for consumers because pack sizes shrink but the prices don't. 'We want simpler pricing so that people can easily compare products to see which is the cheapest.'",

        "document": "A dog walker who spent two years thinking he owned a \u00a3100,000 piece of rare whale vomit has discovered the pungent rock is actually worthless. Ken Wilman thought he had found 'floating gold' when he stumbled across what he believed was a 3kg lump of the highly sought-after ambergris\u00a0on the beach in Morecambe, Lancashire. But his dream of netting a small fortune has now been shattered after an expert in the U.S revealed the 'stone' is not authentic ambergris - and has absolutely no value. Scroll down for video . Ken Wilman, 52, thought he had discovered a \u00a3100,000 piece of rare whale vomit when he found this yellow-grey rock washed up on the beach in Morecambe, Lancashire, while working his dog Madge . An expert in the U.S believes that the pungent  rock has absolutely no value and is not authentic ambergris . Ambergris, or 'grey amber', is the intestinal slurry of sperm whales, which they eject into the ocean - usually when they have a stomach or throat problem. The substance can then float around undiscovered for years in the water, where it hardens and develops into a smooth lump of compact rock which feels waxy and has a sweet smell. It is this aromatic quality which makes it is used in perfumes such as Chanel Number 5. Mr Wilman said: 'If I had my time over again, I would kick the rock to one side and walk away. I wish I'd never found it. I've got to accept what happened and get on with it.' The 52-year-old was walking his boxer dog Madge along the beach in January 2013 when he stumbled across what he believed to be the rare item. The highly sought-after Ambergris, or 'grey amber', is the intestinal slurry of sperm whales, which they eject into the ocean - usually when they have a stomach or throat problem (file picture) Ambergris is the intestinal slurry of sperm whales, which they eject into the ocean - usually when they have a stomach or throat problem. The substance can then float around undiscovered for years in the water, where it hardens and develops its distinctive odour. The decades of floating and exposure to sun and salt will then turn the matter into ambergris, a smooth lump of compact rock which feels waxy and has a sweet smell. It is that quality which means it is highly sought-after with perfume makers, who use it to prolong the scent of perfume. Although ambergris is still an ingredient in perfumes today, producers usually remove it from their product because of the legal ambiguities surrounding its use. As it comes from sperm whale, which is classed as a vulnerable species, cosmetic companies tend to shun using it because it is associated with whaling. But the sweet-smelling sick has been used in a variety of other ways throughout history. Ancient Egyptians reportedly found a use for it by burning ambergris as incense. The country still uses it today for scenting cigarettes. During the Black Death in Europe, worried people also thought they could thwart the plague by carrying a ball of ambergris because the vomit masked the smell, which they thought was the root of the illness. It is rarely found on British beaches, usually being washed up in America and Australia. A French dealer offered him 50,000 Euros if it turned out to be real, while some experts said it could be worth double that quote. But the true value of the stone was discovered when documentary maker Peregrine Andrews -- who produced a Radio 4 show called Ken, Madge and the Strange Rock following the find - sent a sample to an expert across the Atlantic. Christopher Kemp, an American author who wrote a book about ambergris, then broke the news that it was definitely not whale vomit. To add to Mr Wilman's heartbreak, his beloved dog has also passed away since he made the discovery. Mr Andrews said: 'He (Christopher Kemp) emailed me back and said it's definitely not ambergris, although he didn't know what it was. 'Then I had a text from Ken telling me Madge had died. He was in complete shock and then I had to tell him it wasn't real ambergris.' Mr Andrews has since contacted a dealer in New Zealand who has promised to send Mr Wilman a 2g piece of real ambergris. Although it is virtually worthless, Mr Wilman is delighted at the gesture. He said: 'When Peregrine told me, I nearly broke down. I cant believe there are nice people in the world, like this lady, who feels sorry for me and wants to send me a piece of ambergris. 'I've kept a level head about things and I'm trying to find humour in the situation.' Although it is rarely found on British beaches, eight-year-old Charlie Naysmith discovered a 600g piece after taking a stroll along Hengistbury Head, near Bournemouth in 2012. Beachcombers Sean Kane and, 24, and Ian Foster, 39, also discovered a 110lb of whale vomit washed up on the beach in Criccieth, North Wales, in 2008. In 2006 a couple walking on an Australian beach found a 32-pound chunk of ambergris, which netted them $295,000 (\u00a3155,000).",

The boss takes his Barclays Premier League thoroughbreds to Sunderland on Saturday for a crunch clash. The Black Cats are a point and a place ahead of fourth-bottom Villa, who themselves are just three points above the drop zone. Tim Sherwood hopes the Premier League relegation battle does not end up being a photo-finish . And with the Cheltenham Gold Cup on Friday, Sherwood is hoping Villa, who have never been relegated from the Premier League, can avoid being unseated. He said: 'I think it'll be a photo finish and I hope we're not in it. 'We're probably just coming around the corner but it's probably the longest run-in in racing history. 'All we're looking at is the next fence and that's Sunderland. After that we hope we can stay in the running. There might be a few who fall along the way and we're hoping that's not us.' Villa have won their last two under Sherwood, beating West Brom twice in the league and the FA Cup to reach the semi-finals. They were the new manager's first wins since replacing Paul Lambert in February and Sherwood has been impressed with the squad's attitude. 'They've been good and a win makes an awful lot of difference. They have been focused and up for the fight,' he said. 'They haven't dwelt on the position. It's about looking forward now, what we have done previously counts for nothing.' Sherwood, before becoming head coach, was at Tottenham as assistant first-team coach under Harry Redknapp and worked with Sunderland striker Jermain Defoe at White Hart Lane. The 32-year-old returned to England in January after a year with Toronto in Major League Soccer and Sherwood believes Defoe is the Black Cats' chief threat. He said: 'If they are going to survive it's going to be Jermain Defoe who keeps them in the Premier League, that's why they forked out that sort of money for him. 'He didn't have to go, he went for a lifestyle change to Canada but he still has that appetite to come back and play for Sunderland, in a relegation battle. 'Jermain can score goals on his own but he prefers people to slide the ball across the six-yard box for him to be in the right place at the right time, that's what he's done all of his career.'",

Kesshia 'KESH' Kumari, who has more than 80,000 Instagram followers, used the social networking site to express her views about the luxury fashion house. She uploaded a picture of one of the T-shirts she created with American Apparel inspired by her artwork in 2013 next to Versace's offering, which she captioned: 'At least make it better than the $30 (\u00a320) original @versace_official. This looks like a first draft.' She also uploaded a snap of Versace's \u00a3440 Medusa cotton jersey T-shirt and wrote: 'This.hurts. $650.versace rip off. sold out in 3 sizes. what is this madness? from huge designer labels to small boutiques to giant pop stars to fame hungry former friends. what is this? 'Why can't these companies. these brands. these people create their own work? what happened? why do these people think that everything that they lay their eyes on instantly belongs to them? (sic)'. MailOnline has contacted Kesshia Kumari for comment. In an interview with The Cut, the London-born designer said: 'I have always had a deep admiration for Versace. It\u2019s an iconic brand that has stood the test of time. I am deeply disappointed in this. 'This is not only artwork from a show that took me two years to develop and create. It is not only artwork from a collection that I created for American Apparel to provide something affordable and accessible to supporters of my work. ' But this is also my face! I can\u2019t understand how something like this could happen.' Kesshia Kumari, who is of Malaysian and Trinidadian heritage, began designing her graphic creations 17 years ago and began selling them on MySpace. The Versace T-shirt's description on Selfridges website reads: 'Versace\u2019s flair for contemporary prints can be seen with this statement t-shirt. Crafted from cotton-jersey and featuring Medusa\u2019s head printed on the front, simply team with jeans for a luxe off-duty look.' MailOnline has contacted Versace for comment. Speaking to MailOnline,\u00a0Jim Dennis, an intellectual property partner at law firm Gordon Dadds, the English member firm at Globalaw, said: 'Kesh\u2019s design is certainly distinctive and the Versace design is strikingly similar. Provided Kesh\u2019s design is original, then under UK law it will attract copyright as a graphic work. 'It is for the Court to decide whether Versace has copied Kesh\u2019s design but the similarities between the designs are so substantial the Court may readily infer that copying has taken place. If so, Versace would infringe Kesh\u2019s copyright unless they can prove with clear evidence that they created their design independently and without reference to Kesh\u2019s. If they are found to infringe then they may be liable for damages to Kesh or have to hand over their profits from sales of the offending t-shirts.' Carissa Kendall-Palmer, associate solicitor, EIP in London, added: 'In short, Kesh should be filing a law suit right away. The Versace T-shirt is clearly very similar to the T-shirt she developed for the American Apparel range in 2013. On the face of it, Kesh has a good case, but will need to gather evidence to support it. 'The design could be protected by both design rights and copyright, and it certainly looks like a bit of a rip-off. Many fashion brands rely heavily on these unregistered rights and at times, it can be complicated and expensive to prove their case. She is not on her own here. Copying is very common in the industry. 'There is always the possibility that Versace has a good excuse but it will take some explaining. Copyright infringement is criminal, and if Kesh registered her design, copying that is also a criminal offence under the new 2014 laws. If Kesh has a registered design, she will find it easier to assert her legal rights now.'",

Fill your snow boots: Norway can be an inexpensive alternative to the Alps . The slopes are snow-sure well into April, prices are reasonable and families are exceptionally well catered for. My wife and I have two children, Maisie, five and Imogen, three. That's young to start skiing, but I was told that Trysil would do the trick. After an easy transfer from Oslo airport, we arrived at the Radisson Blu, one of two ski-in ski-out hotels. There is ten-pin bowling, an American-style diner, a soft play area and a vast multi-pool swimming area that would prove to be a huge hit with my lot. It is also right by the nursery slopes - our first morning found us riding the magic carpet to ski school. Maisie was in a class of five, Imogen was with three others. And by a happy quirk, they were being taught by two sisters, both delightful. By the second day, she was riding the mini drag lift and Imogen was padding around on her skis, searching for stuffed toy lions and monkeys around the kids area. Easy does it: Trysil can be a perfect ski destination for families with young children . By the end of the week, both were skiing better than I could have hoped. Trysil has four main ski areas, all with excellent nursery slopes - with easy routes down from all points. The ski school also runs a drop-in creche from 10.45am to 3pm for \u00a38 an hour per child, with a 30 per cent discount for siblings. We used this for our own ski time. The slopes are surprisingly extensive. Hogegga is an area with mostly black runs - and new for this season is the first of a series of new gladed trails through woods. Skihytta is a charming mountain hut serving its own beers, and moose shot by the owner. Knettsettra is another must-visit mid-mountain restaurant and bar. It hosts free concerts for up to 5,000 people in March and April. The one sting in the tail is the cost of alcohol. A draft half-litre of beer cost me \u00a36.50 and a bottle of wine \u00a335. But the well-priced food balanced this out over the week. And it was not just about the skiing. Downhill all the way: Trysil has slopes for skiers all abilities, within quick reach of Oslo . We also took the girls dog-sledding across a beautifully scenic plateau, and our highlight of the week was a horse sleigh ride with a stop-off in a Nordic yurt to cook hot dogs over an open fire. The girls definitely developed a taste for skiing, and we have a new love affair with Trysil. We are already thinking about going back for half-term next year. Roll on February 2016. Ski Safari (01273 224 068, www.skisafari.com) offers holidays for a family of four (two adults, two children) from \u00a33,100, based on a seven-night stay at the 4*+ Radisson Blu Resort on a half-board basis - including flights and transfers. Packages are now on sale for February 2016 half-term. Children's ski hire costs \u00a330 for a week; a five-day package of 90-minute group lessons costs \u00a3100. Children under six ski free.

        "document": "A Lingerie Bowl player and personal assistant was forced to go topless in front of her boss's friends and babysit his prostitutes when he passed out, she claims in a lawsuit. Lotti Bluemner, 31, accuses investor Erik Gordon, 41, of coercing her into exposing her bare breasts in front of crowds so he could snort cocaine off them to impress women. His requests did not stop even after she got pregnant, according to court documents seen by the New York Post. Suing Gordon, head of Ergo Media Capital LLC, for unfair dismissal, Bluemner is demanding $13 million in damages. Battle: Lotti Bluemner (right) claims she felt compelled to expose her breasts for Erik Gordon (left) and his A-list friends at drug-fueled parties in order to keep her $90,000-a-year job as his personal assistant in LA . Past career: Bluemner was a kicker for LA Temptation in the 2006 Lingerie Bowl tournament, coming second . Bluemner, from Brookfield, Wisconsin, featured in Lingerie Bowl, which involved women playing full-contact football in their underwear, pads and helmets. A kicker for LA Temptation in the 2006 tournament, she helped secure victory against Dallas Desire in the semi-finals but ultimately lost to New York Euphoria. Her $90,000-a-year job was meant to be an administrative role at Gordon's home in LA, organizing his diary, the Post reported. However, in court documents seen by DailyMail.com, she claims she was used to 'essentially babysit' as Gordon went 'partying, drinking, and consuming various illegal drugs each night... as well as regularly engaging strippers and prostitutes.' Gordon rejects Bluemner's claims and says that she stole $1,200 from his credit card at the Apple store . 'Used': Bluemner's lawsuit claims she was used to help Gordon pick up women . She adds that 'Gordon's modus operandi, consisted of trading upon his father's (one of the founders of Angelo & Gordon) wealth, fame, connections, and political capital by taking meetings during the day with his and his father's wealthy and politically connected friends, celebrities, and politicians' before partying. And she was ordered, she says, to take his new girlfriend on multi-thousand dollar shopping sprees. In papers seen by DailyMail.com, Gordon rejects the accusations and claims Bluemner used his credit card to spend $1,229.51 on personal items from the Apple store. Bluemner denies theft. Now based in Florida, with business in New York, Gordon has filed his counter claim in Manhattan, while Bluemner's case will be heard in California's Federal Court. Gordon told the Post: 'Everyone who knows me and knows Ms. Bluemner has found humor in her bizarre allegations . . . I have countless friends who are women who have faced horrific instances of hostile work environments and quid-pro-quo sexual harassment. Ms. Bluemner's complaint . . . does each of them an injustice.'",

        "document": "An armed robbery of  an 18-wheeler truck transporting bars of gold from Florida to Massachusetts was most likely an inside job, according to police. The $4.8 million gold heist by three armed robbers unfolded after one of the two armed guards  said that he felt sick and prompted the driver to pull over. But Wilson County Sheriff Calvin Woodard Jr. said Wednesday that different stories have emerged about the trip\u00a0from Bridgewater, Massachusetts on I-95. Scroll down for video . Investigation: Wilson County Sheriff Calvin Woodard Jr, pictured, said that differing stories from the guards about the armed robbery had led to suspicions over their accounts of heist . Suspects:\u00a0Woodard shared sketches of the suspects thought to be male and possibly Hispanic who allegedly bound the hands of the driver and the passenger - there are three suspects altogether . White van: Two security guards working for Transvalue Inc of Miami were reportedly approached by three armed men driving a white van, pictured here, after pulling over on the interstate . In the latest account of events, one of the two armed guards said that he felt sick and this is why the driver pulled over. However, in an earlier description the guards, \u00a0employed by Miami-based company, TransValue Inc. said a mechanical issue had caused the driver to stop. The guards said that after the vehicle stopped they were approached by three armed men driving a white van who ordered them to lie on the ground. They then tied their hands behind their backs and marched them into nearby woods before taking 275lbs of gold. Woodward told reporters that these differing accounts have led to further investigations. 'There is suspicion at this time that this could be an inside job due to the circumstances of the robbery,'\u00a0a Wilson County Sheriff's Office detective wrote in a search warrant obtained by ABC. 'The fact that the truck was robbed immediately upon it pulling over at an unannounced stop is suspicious in and of itself,' the document added. Search: Armed robbers are suspected of stealing $4million in gold from an 18-wheeler taking the precious from Florida to Massachusetts on Interstate 95. Above, deputies investigate a wooded area near the road . Location: The men 'ordered the guards to lie on the ground, tied their hands behind their backs and marched them into nearby woods, before taking 275lbs gold' Cone: This photo is of a traffic cone that was positioned behind the truck as suspects allegedly removed gold from the vehicle after breaking a lock on the back . 'It is also suspicious because there are no markings on the side of the truck that would indicate the type of cargo contained therein. 'The suspects also went directly to the trailer and found the gold which was in unmarked five gallon buckets. It is not believed that this is a random act due to the nature and facts of this robbery.' Police are now seeking a search warrant for the phones of the armed guard who felt sick because of the suspicious nature of the case. Woodard shared sketches of the three suspects who allegedly bound the hands of the driver and the passenger. Meanwhile, a photo was shown of a traffic cone that was positioned behind the truck as suspects allegedly removed gold from the vehicle after breaking a lock on the back. The traffic cone had the marking of a company that only does work in Florida, according to ABC. Woodard said the driver and the passenger, who speak little English, are not suspects, but both men have been interviewed separately several times by police. He added that the driver and the passenger did violate their company\u2019s policies by exiting the vehicle without their firearms and leaving the firearms inside the truck. Wilson County Sheriff's Deputies investigate an area near Interstate 95 in Wilson, North Carolina, on Monday . Investigation: The Federal Bureau of Investigation has joined in the search for the robbers, thought to be male and possibly Hispanic. Neither of the guards was injured during the 'very rare incident', TransValue said . A reported 275lbs of gold were stolen and silver was also being carried in the truck, which was stopped near mile marker 114 on the highway. Locks on the back of the truck were sawed off, according to WITN. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has joined in the search for the robbers, thought to be male and possibly Hispanic. A reported 275lbs of gold were stolen, though it is not known which form the truck's precious metal took (file photo) The metal was owned by Republic Metals Corporation in Opalocka, Florida, according to a search warrant. TransValue, which specializes in transporting valuable goods and money between financial centers, keeps goods they move insured for up to $100million. A $50,000 reward is on offer for information leading to an arrest. Shortly after the heist confused drivers told 911 dispatchers that they saw uniformed drivers run into the North Carolina highway with their hands bound, motioning for help, according to recordings.",

        "document": "Alexandra Walkden, 62, was left virtually toothless after her dentist of 30 years failed to provide proper treatment for gum disease . A grandmother claims she was left 'looking like Nanny McPhee' after 13 of her teeth fell out due to dodgy dental treatment. Alexandra Walkden, 62, was left virtually toothless after her dentist of 30 years failed to provide proper treatment for gum disease. Her grandchildren likened her appearance to the screen governess with magical powers played by Emma Thompson. As a result, she was forced to pay \u00a324,000 to undergo painful surgery for dental implants. Now Mrs Walkden, a telesales worker from Preston, Lancashire, has won \u00a335,000 damages in an out of court settlement after taking legal action against the dentist, Dr John Musgrave, 57. She said: 'I had to have surgery to remove 13 teeth and eventually have implants fitted. 'I looked like somebody who had been in a car crash. I had black eyes, swollen mouth and I couldn't eat for a week. It's ruined my life. I don't want this to happen to anyone else. 'My grandchildren would call my Nanny McPhee when I didn't have my dentures in because I had just one tooth at the top.' Mrs Walkden had been a patient of Dr Musgrave at the Preston-based Incisive Dental Practice for 30 years and attended dental appointments with him every six months. She said: 'During these years I didn't think anything was wrong. I'd get the all clear. 'Or I would say I was having problems and he would say he would have a poke around and say its fine and to see him in six months. 'If there were problems or a tooth was twinging, he would look at it or find a cavity and say it needs filling. I trusted him implicitly. Whatever he said, I believed. She added: 'As far as I know he did a routine check but he never told me I had gum disease. He never offered for me to see a hygienist.' The truth emerged during a holiday in 2013 with her partner when Mrs Walkden's crown fell out and she went to see a local dentist. To her horror, it emerged her teeth were rotting from the inside out. She said: 'When I went to see him the first thing he said was \"when was the last time you went to the dentist?\". 'When I said \"3 months ago\", he said \"that's not what your teeth are telling me\". 'I was completely shocked. We cut our holiday short and came home. 'I went to another dentist close to home and they confirmed I was going to lose all my top set of teeth.' 'You can't imagine the reaction when someone tell you they will have to take all your teeth out. It was horrible. 'They asked if I wanted to sit down.. It was a feeling that was absolutely horrendous. I had 13 teeth removed. 'I also had a wisdom tooth on the bottom removed that was beyond saving and had to have an implant to replace that wisdom tooth.' Despite paying for regular private dental treatment for 30 years, Mrs Walkden was horrified to be told by another dentist that her teeth were rotting from the inside out - and the top row would need to be removed . Her grandchildren likened her appearance to Nanny McPhee, the screen governess with magical powers played by Emma Thompson. Mrs Walkden, had to endure a number of deep cleaning treatments to treat the gum disease before all but four of her top set of teeth were removed. She said: 'I had to go through a few treatments of that. I have never experienced pain like that before as they clean beneath the gum line - it's very high powered. It was like torture but it had to be done. 'Then I went to have my teeth extracted, all but 4 at first. They fitted me there and then with a partial denture.' 'I had to get used to something so alien in my mouth and learn how to speak again as it changes the shape of your mouth. I didn't want to be left with dentures for the rest of time.' Mrs Walkden eventually underwent implant surgery in April 2013 and had to go to the dentist every week. She said: 'I have spent hours at the dentists and thousands of pounds and I have only been left with around \u00a311,000 for pain and suffering. 'Compensation is not a \"pay out\". No amount of money can compensate for having lost my teeth. 'The money I've received will be used to cover the thousands of pounds I have paid out of my own pocket for all the necessary remedial and cosmetic work. 'If I weren't fortunate enough to have been able to fund my treatments while the case was being fought, I don't know what state my mouth would be in right now.' She added: 'This is all because this dentist didn't do proper checks. If he had done X-rays he would have known. It is basically negligence. 'I put the time in going to the dentists and I expected to be taken care of. If you look at the dentists records you see check-up after check-up every 6 months. You just don't expect to end up going through this.' 'I felt utterly betrayed by Dr Musgrave when I found out the extent of the damage to my teeth and gums. 'I've worked hard all my life to pay for extra things in life like private dental insurance and have never missed a dentist appointment. Mrs Walkden was forced to pay \u00a324,000 to undergo painful surgery for dental implants. She has now won \u00a335,000 damages in an out of court settlement after taking legal action against the dentist, Dr John Musgrave . She said:\u00a0'If I weren't fortunate enough to have been able to fund my treatments while the case was being fought, I don't know what state my mouth would be in right now' 'I thought I was taking good care of my teeth and assumed that my dental insurer would have taken steps to screen its members. It was wrong to assume that my dentist's inclusion on the insurance register was a quality guarantee. 'It ruined my confidence. In that situation you just don't want to go anywhere - it's horrendous. It does nothing for your confidence and leaves you very self-conscious.' Associate solicitor, Heather Owen at the Dental Law Partnership which represented Mrs Walkden said: 'Alexandra's case was one of long-term mistreatment, compounded by a string of failures by her dentist Dr Musgrave. 'He routinely failed to check the health of her teeth, screen for gum disease, remove decay or even carry out appropriate preventative care. 'At no point was the patient advised of alternative treatment options or referred to specialists when her oral health started to decline.' Dr Musgrave, who did not admit liability, refused to comment.",

Now that the Alaskan husky brothers are nearing age 10, NH Sled Dog Rescue is looking to retire them and hope to send the two inseparable friends to the same family. Both Gonzo and Poncho were born with sight but in 2010, trainers started to realize Gonzo was losing his sight when he started tripping over his food. Inseparable: Blind sled dog Gonzo (left) is currently up for adoption with his brother Poncho (right), who has been acting as his sight on the trails for years. Both are currently up for adoption, and their rescue center hopes to find them a home where they can live together . When his blindness was initially diagnosed, a veterinarian urged his owners to keep him on the sled dog team, and that's when Poncho stepped up to the plate. 'At first it kind of upset him (Poncho) because it slightly hindered his ability to run straight because Gonzo was leaning up against him,' musher Wes Guerin told WMUR. 'Over time, Poncho kind of realized he was the only thing keeping his brother on the trail. He started to help him. If there was a left turn coming up or a right turn, he'd pull him this way or nudge him that way and do whatever he had to do to make sure he (Gonzo) didn't run off the trail or anything like that,' Guerin said. On the off occasion that Gonzo has run off the trail, Poncho has picked him up out of ditches by dragging him by the collar. A dog's seeing eye dog: Gonzo's sight first started failing in 2010, but his brother Poncho stepped in and helped direct him on sled dog runs. Poncho (left) and Gonzo (right) pictured above in 2013 . Runners: For years the brothers ran with Muddy Paw Sled Dog Kennel in Jefferson, New Hampshire giving tours in the winter months . 'I've run dogs in a lot of places, all over the country, and it was the most amazing thing I've ever seen sled dogs do,' musher Neil Beaulieu told the Associated Press in 2013. While the reliance on Poncho worked for several years, Gonzo eventually had to quit sled running this fall, when a doctor removed the other eye that was giving him limited sight. Since then he has become quite accustomed to life as an office dog while his brother continues to exercise with the other 131 dogs at the no-kill shelter. Retirement-ready dogs at\u00a0NH Sled Dog Rescue\u00a0can be adopted for a fee of $250, part of which goes to supporting the shelter. This year they have about 40 dogs up for sale at their Jefferson, New Hampshire facility. Alaskan huskies can live to age 16.",

        "document": "(CNN)Australia lodged a formal complaint Friday over the treatment of two drug smugglers sentenced to death in Indonesia during their transfer to an island where they are expected to face execution. During the transfer, a senior Indonesian police officer was pictured in photos with the Australian pair on a flight. Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan were being taken from Kerobokan prison in Bali to Nusakambangan island in Central Java, where they will be held in a maximum security facility before facing a 12-man firing squad. The date of the execution is not yet known, although the convicted will be informed at least 72 hours before they are put to death. Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs said it had lodged a formal complaint with the Indonesian embassy in Canberra over the treatment of the prisoners during the transfer, which took place before dawn on Wednesday. Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop told Australian media that an undue show of force, including armored vehicles and dozens of officers in helmets and balaclavas, was also used during the transfer. \"I just cannot comprehend it. They are two men who are described by their own prison governors as model citizens, two gentlemen who pose no risk to anyone,\" she told the ABC's AM program. \"I cannot comprehend the manner or the method of their transfer to the so-called execution island.\" A spokesman for Indonesia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the photos were taken without the consent of the officer involved,  Commissioner Djoko Hari Utomo. \"The officer was inquiring about the physical condition of Mr Chan,\" Arrmanatha Nasir told CNN in regard to one of the images. \"It is regretful that this photo is being used by the media to portray something more than what it really is.\" Australia's complaint comes after Indonesia dismissed a last-minute proposal to save the pair's lives through a prisoner swap. Nasir told CNN that there are no Indonesian laws that would allow or provide for an exchange. \"Indonesia does not have legislation or laws or any other legal instruments that will enable the issue of a prisoner exchange to be conducted,\" he said, adding that the Australian government had been informed of this stance. Sukumaran and Chan, members of the so-called \"Bali Nine\" smuggling ring, have been held by Indonesian authorities for nearly a decade. They are expected to be held in a maximum security facility on Nusakambangan where they will be isolated before being put to death. They are among a number of people from different countries who are also scheduled for execution. Australian government and opposition parliamentarians attended a candlelight vigil at dawn Thursday, as a spectacular sunrise lit politicians from across Australia's political spectrum, united in opposition to the impending executions. \"We appeal to the Indonesian president to grant a stay of clemency,\" Bishop told the gathering. She reminded the Indonesian government that legal avenues remained open, before appealing for mercy on behalf of the convicted men's families. \"I've spoken to the families. They are going through an unimaginably difficult time and I ask that you think of the families who are praying that their son, brother, grandson can have their life spared. We appeal again to President Widodo, the leader of a strong and proud country, to show mercy and forgiveness and spare the lives of these two young Australians.\" Australia has repeatedly appealed for clemency for the pair. They have been jailed since April 2005 for a failed bid to smuggle more than 8 kilograms of heroin from Bali to Australia. OPINION: Why executions won't win Indonesia's drug war . Prime Minister Tony Abbott said people should not let anger affect Australians' relationship with Indonesia. \"We abhor drug crime, but we abhor the death penalty. We think that these two Australians deserve to be punished, but they certainly don't deserve to be executed,\" he said. The Bali Nine were arrested after Indonesian police received a tip from Australian Federal Police. Chan, 31, was called the ringleader of the plot, and Sukumaran was described as Chan's collaborator in the scheme. Seven other people who participated in the plan are serving lengthy prison sentences. Police caught four people at the Denpasar airport with more than 8 kilograms of heroin strapped to their bodies. Another four -- including Sukumaran -- were arrested at a hotel in the village of Kuta. Chan was detained after a boarding a plane to Sydney -- he wasn't carrying any drugs but was named by others as the mastermind of the plot. The Indonesian administrative court last week dismissed a case filed by lawyers of the two Australians against President Joko Widodo. The attorneys wanted a review of the president's decision to deny them clemency. Todung Mulya Lubis, who represents the pair, said a challenge had been submitted to the administrative court and lawyers were still waiting for a court summons. \"There should be no execution as long as there is a legal process going on,\" Lubis said. Sukumaran and Chan have become model prisoners during their time behind bars, according to fellow inmates and the jail's chief warden. Sukumaran is studying fine arts and has set up a class for fellow inmates. Chan has found spirituality, which he uses to counsel inmates with drug problems. Their rehabilitation is genuine, Bishop has previously said. \"Andrew and Myuran are the model of what penal systems the world over long to achieve,\" she told the Australian Parliament in February. Indonesia has long taken a tough line on drug smugglers, and Widodo has made it clear he doesn't intend to introduce a policy of leniency. In December, six prisoners were killed by firing squad, including five foreigners from Brazil, the Netherlands, Malawi, Nigeria and Vietnam. Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff issued a statement saying the execution of one of her countrymen had \"severely affected\" relations with Indonesia. CNN's Steve Almasy, Camille Feanny and Jennifer Deaton contributed to this report.",

        "document": "Planets wandering through space, unattached to any star or solar system, may be much more common that previously thought, according to an expert. The planets are hard to find because, without orbiting a star, they reflect very little light. But 50 have now been found in the past 15 years, leading some to suggest they may be abundant in the universe. Ashley Yeager for Science News has explained that solo planets (artist's impression shown) could be common. This is thanks to more regions of dust and gas than we thought. Planets become 'rogue' when they are ejected or form on their own and about 50 have been found in the last 15 years . The potential for these free-floating planets to be common was discussed in an article by Ashley Yeager for Science News. Rogue planets, or interstellar planets, are planetary objects that were either formed by themselves or were ejected from a system. A brown dwarf is commonly regarded as the \u2018missing link\u2019 between stars and planets. They are too large to be classed as true planets, but too small to have ignited nuclear fusion at their cores and be classed as stars. When a celestial body first forms, its size will determine what sort of object it becomes. As a star forms from a cloud of gas, its core becomes so large that hydrogen fuses into helium.\u00a0Conversely, a planet forms into a smaller sphere that is not large enough to have nuclear fusion at its core. Brown dwarfs fall somewhere in between. They are the size between a gas giant like Jupiter and a small star. Their mass, meanwhile, can be anything from 15 to 75 times the mass of Jupiter. This is not enough to sustain fusion but, owing to their size, this has led astronomers to coin brown dwarfs \u2018failed stars\u2019. As they don't emit much light it\u2019s thought there may be many rogue brown dwarfs drifting through the galaxy waiting to be discovered. How abundant they are in the universe, though, has been the cause of some debate. But Ms Yeager explained so-called globulettes - regions of dust and gas that can form planets - could make them more common than thought. The number of possible planets in one such region is not known, and this depends on what the boundary between cloud density and planet formation is. \u2018Globulettes are very numerous,\u2019 Dr Thomas Haworth from the University of Cambridge told Science News. \u2018Even if only a small fraction can be made to collapse, they could make a significant contribution to the population of free-floating planets.\u2019 Rogue planets are of particular interest to astronomers because they represent objects that have likely failed to form into a star. Brown dwarfs, for example, are substellar objects that are not massive enough to sustain fusion, but are still more than 13 times the mass of Jupiter. The exact boundary between a giant planet and a low-mass brown dwarf is still being debated, but finding more rogue planets could shed light on this mystery. And this could indicate that there are more rogue planets than we know of in the cosmos. Yeager explained that so-called globulettes - regions of dust and gas that can form planets - could make them more common than first thought. However, the number of possible planets that can be found in one such region  is not known. Shown is a star-forming region known as Thackeray's Globules .",

The average home in East Horsley, which has a private sports club, decent schools and nearby riding schools and golf courses, now sells for \u00a31,006,304, property experts Savills said. Property listings show numerous homes listed for sale for more than \u00a31million, many featuring sprawling lawns, open plan kitchens and huge double garages. Sophie Chick, associate director at Savills, said that the cost of housing in cities and towns means that villages now offer comparatively good value for money. \u2018We\u2019ve actually found that since the credit crunch, villages on the whole have underperformed their neighbouring towns and cities,\u2019 she said. \u2018This is because there has been a marked preference for living within an urban environment, closer to a work place, resulting in affluent UK cities and towns outperforming their neighbouring villages and rural locations in the housing market. \u2018This means villages now represent good value and there is a currently good buying opportunity.\u2019 This East Horsley property, listed online for \u00a31,395,000 by Savills, features a massive back yard which backs onto woodland . Inside, it boasts of oak doors and staircases and claims to be an original Frank Chown build, created in 1923 .

        "document": "Victor Valdes says he can have no complaints about sitting on the bench at Manchester United as he regards his rival David de Gea as the best goalkeeper in the world. Louis van Gaal won the race to sign Valdes in January, but his only appearances in a United shirt so far have come in the Under-21 side. Despite being a three-time Champions League winner, Valdes is yet to turn out for the senior team simply because De Gea's form has been nothing short of outstanding. Victor Valdes (right) says his compatriot and team-mate David de Gea (left) is the finest keeper in the world . The former Barca man admits he doesn't mind warming the Old Trafford bench if De Gea is No 1 . Valdes bears no ill feeling towards his fellow Spaniard though. He can only marvel at his performances. 'You are always waiting for your opportunity to play and train every day to show your performance to the manager,' the former Barcelona goalkeeper told United Uncovered. 'But now David is at a very, very high performance level. 'I think he is the most important goalkeeper in the world at the moment. So it is difficult [for me] to play and, of course, I must accept this. 'For me, the top [keeper] now is David. I see him every day in training. I watch him in every game, every week, and his performances right now are amazing.' Negotiations have begun between De Gea and United over an extension to his current contract, which expires next year. Negotiations have begun between De Gea and United over an extension to his current contract . If they are unsuccessful, Real Madrid will surely pounce to sign the 24-year-old, whose Madrid-based girlfriend Edurne Garcia made it clear that she is not a fan of Manchester this week. Valdes, 33, will have a tough job on his hands winning over the fans if he replaces De Gea in goal next season. 'Every week he makes saves to help the team so I am very happy for him and also for the fans,' said Valdes, who is contracted until the end of next season. 'I always hear them sing the song of David de Gea, so I think they are very happy with David for the level of performance he has shown in the last few years. I feel the fans are definitely very happy with the job he is doing.' De Gea's latest impressive display came on Monday when he prevented Alexis Sanchez and Santi Cazorla from making United's FA Cup exit to Arsenal even more painful. One of the few times De Gea has been upstaged this season came on December 28 when Hugo Lloris pulled off a number of excellent saves to earn Tottenham a 0-0 draw against United at White Hart Lane. United management team Louis van Gaal (left) and Ryan Giggs face the test of Tottenham on Sunday . De Gea still put in a top performance in north London, and on Sunday he is likely to be busy once more when Spurs come to Old Trafford thanks to Harry Kane's form. Van Gaal, a sincere believer in youth development, has been impressed by the fact that Spurs academy graduate Kane has scored 26 goals in his breakthrough year with the club. 'The way [Kane] is scoring is a reason for their success,' Van Gaal said. 'That's one aspect of the world of football that a big talent can stand up in one season and he is doing that. 'I like the process in Tottenham because there also you can see that a lot of experienced players are not playing and a lot of youngsters are playing. Old Trafford boss Van Gaal identified the scoring sensation Harry Kane as a factor to Tottenham's success . 'In spite of that they are also very close (to the top four) and are playing attacking football. 'I like Tottenham. It is not easy to play Tottenham. 'They have a lot of talent . 'I hope we can beat them because it will be very difficult again.' Sunday's game marks the start of a tough run of fixtures for United, who then face Liverpool, Aston Villa, Manchester City and Chelsea. The Red Devils are fourth in the table, just two points in front of Liverpool and three ahead of Spurs. Van Gaal will be without Robin van Persie on Sunday as he remains sidelined with an ankle injury. Jonny Evans and Angel di Maria are suspended while Marcos Rojo is a doubt due to a groin problem. \u00c2 .",

        "document": "London (CNN)The handwritten checklist looks like something any teenaged girl might make ahead of a vacation trip:  makeup, bras, underwear, boots, an epilator. But this list was apparently made by the three UK schoolgirls suspected of traveling from London to Syria to join ISIS, according to Britain's Guardian newspaper, which has seen the document. The girls' families told British lawmakers Tuesday they had no idea what the girls were planning, and said they were baffled by the teenagers' decision to leave their homes and families. The three East London classmates -- Shamima Begum, 15; Kadiza Sultana, 16; and Amira Abase, 15 -- boarded a Turkish Airlines plane from London's Gatwick Airport to Istanbul on February 17. They are thought to have crossed the Turkish border into Syria within days. Relatives also had harsh words for police, who they said failed to keep them informed after a close friend of the girls headed to Syria in December. Amira Abase's father, Hussen Abase, told lawmakers at a hearing of the Home Affairs Select Committee that he had no idea his daughter was planning to go or that she might have been radicalized. Sahima Begum, the older sister of Shamima Begum, said her sister had been into \"normal teenage things,\" like watching \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians,\" reading and playing games on her phone. There was nothing to indicate she was radicalized, she said. Fahmida Aziz, first cousin of Kadiza Sultana, said that if the family had spotted any signs of radicalization, \"we would have been very effective in stepping in and querying\" that thinking. She also said she had no idea how her cousin accessed the money needed for the trip. Committee chairman Keith Vaz said it was \"every parent's nightmare that this should happen\" and said he could only imagine the families' distress and anguish. Who are the missing UK girls? The families' criticism of law enforcement hinges on a February 5 letter from the police which was given to the three girls to give to their parents, rather than being sent directly to the parents. The families claim they were not told about a 15-year-old friend of the girls going to Syria weeks earlier -- and say that had they known, they might have been able to prevent their daughters from traveling too. Metropolitan Police Chief Bernard Hogan-Howe apologized for his officers' failure to get the letter directly to the parents, in his testimony before the committee. But he also pointed out the difficulties for police in conducting what was at that time a missing person inquiry for the first girl who left, with no sign that these three were planning to follow suit. Hogan-Howe said police were reviewing their procedures in light of what had happened. Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley told the committee there was a \"steady flow\" of girls trying to travel to Syria, perhaps one or two a month. He said subsequent police investigations indicated the three girls had paid in cash for their plane tickets to Turkey at a local travel agency, using money linked to the theft of jewelry from their families. None of the girls was reported missing until several hours after the flight had left for Istanbul. However, the families' lawyer asked how they had managed, as minors, to board the flight without being challenged. CCTV footage also later showed that the girls spent much of the next day waiting at a bus station on the outskirts of Istanbul -- raising more questions about why they were not spotted then and whether UK police had communicated effectively with Turkish authorities. Rowley said that two people have been arrested in relation to child abduction in relation to the first girl who went missing, who has not been named. Asked how the UK might be able to get the girls back, Rowley cited an incentive: As long as they're not connected to terrorist offenses, they'll be able to return to their families. Rowley said police have no evidence that the girls have been involved in terrorism-related activities, and if that remained the case, they wouldn't be treated as terrorists upon their return. Who has been recruited to ISIS from the West? The list was reportedly found in the bedroom of one of the girls and handed to police after her family realized she was missing. It detailed items to buy, such as underwear, a mobile phone and cosmetics, and estimated travel costs, apparently totaling \u00a32,190 ($3,296). The biggest single cost was the three plane tickets to Turkey, the newspaper said, at just over \u00a31,000. The list, written on a page from a diary planner, had initials indicating which of the girls was to buy what or who the items were for. It's not clear where they would have gotten the money to meet the costs. Over the weekend, the girls' families asked for an apology from London's Metropolitan Police over the force's handling of the case. The police said in a statement Saturday that after the first girl went missing in December, a police officer spoke to seven of her school friends at Bethnal Green Academy -- including Shamima, Kadiza, and Amira -- as potential witnesses who might have information about the missing girl. A deputy principal at the girls' school was present for the meeting and afterward contacted the parents of the seven girls, on the advice of police, and told them that the girls' friend, referred to only as \"Girl 1,\" had been reported missing. An officer who then spoke to the same group of girls on February 5 gave them the letters addressed to their parents asking for further help from their daughters, the police statement said. But not all the letters were passed on. \"With the benefit of hindsight, we acknowledge that the letters could have been delivered direct to the parents,\" the police statement said. \"However, the parents were already aware from the Deputy Head that Girl 1 had been reported missing, all the teenagers were all being co-operative, they were all being treated as potential witnesses and there was nothing whatsoever to indicate that they themselves were planning to travel to Syria.\" What is ISIS' appeal for young people? Days before they left for Turkey, at least one of the girls allegedly contacted a young woman, Aqsa Mahmood, who left her home in Scotland to travel to Syria in 2013 and is accused of trying to recruit others via social media. She has posted tips for girls and young women wanting to travel to Syria to marry jihadis, as she did. Her blog also has links to advice posted by another jihad supporter, which recommends that those traveling to Syria seek to pack the essentials but not too much, since they may need to move often and at short notice, while remaining inconspicuous.

        "document": "Ricky Haruna (pictured) whose duties included guarding Kate Middleton, said she was fired from the Met Police after complaining about racism . A decorated female police officer who sued Britain's biggest police force for racial discrimination after claiming she was called a n***** by a colleague has won her case and will return to work. Ricky Haruna, 39, whose duties included guarding Kate Middleton, said she was fired from London's Metropolitan Police last June after complaining about racism and launched a case for harassment and wrongful dismissal. She is now returning to duty after an appeals tribunal backed her claims. PC Haruna was sacked from the force after what she called a 'malicious arrest' over an alleged fraud, one of three claims which led to her dismissal, and which she was later cleared of. She told the tribunal the Met only took disciplinary action against her because she pursued the racism complaints. She said: 'There was no evidence on which any reasonable, unbiased panel would have dismissed me.' The racist abuse started in 2010 when a suspected shoplifter called her 'midnight' - a racist term used in South London. She said instead of supporting her other officers present 'appeared to laugh'. She added she did not receive support from senior officers when she told them a colleague called her 'a n*****'. She said: 'After that I was harassed and \u00ad victimised by racist police officers and those that support and cover up for racists in senior management.' She also said she was excluded from a staff Christmas dinner, telling the tribunal: 'I was the only black police officer and only female police officer based in that office at the time and I felt singled out and picked on.' She was sacked seven years after she was pictured alongside Kate Middleton - then Prince William's girlfriend - and who she regularly escorted. PC Haruna was sacked from the force after a 'malicious arrest' over an alleged fraud which she was later cleared of. She is pictured holding the two commendations which she was awarded by the force in 2007 . Although she cannot speak about the case as she is now re-employed by the force, her lawyer Lawrence Davies said: 'She was devastated to be unlawfully dismissed and elated to be reinstated. 'She very much looks forward to rebuilding her career in the Met Police,' he told the Sunday Mirror. He previously said: 'When PC Haruna reported the bullying in the workplace, rather than support her, the Met's response was to target her and sack her.' PC Haruna joined the Met in January 2002 after graduating in sociology and criminology from Goldsmiths, \u00adUniversity of London. She saved the lives of two people during her career and was awarded two commendations. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'Her disciplinary process was prompted by a public complaint regarding alleged criminal conduct which was investigated by the Directorate of Professional Standards. 'It is only right that such complaints are investigated, however, the steps taken by the MPS in this instance will be reviewed in the light of the PAT findings.' PC Haruna told the tribunal the Met only took action against her because she pursued the racism complaints .",

        "document": "When James Corden was surprisingly chosen to host America\u2019s top chat show, fans and critics alike wondered if the British star would flourish in such an unfamiliar role. Yet Corden\u2019s first week in the hot-seat on CBS\u2019s The Late Late Show has been so widely acclaimed that he is now being tipped as a front-runner to host the prestigious Golden Globes awards next year \u2013 the Hollywood party second only to the Oscars for star quality. \u2018Out of nowhere, he\u2019s suddenly a realistic contender for one of the most coveted awards-hosting jobs of the year,\u2019 said a source close to the Globes. \u2018He\u2019s only been hosting The Late Late Show for a few days, but already Hollywood is sitting up and taking notice. Scroll down for video . Roaring success: James Corden's debut on The Late Late Show with Mila Kunis and Tom Hanks . \u2018James has shown that he\u2019s funny, can sing and dance, puts celebrities at their ease, and doesn\u2019t dismiss stars with snark. \u2018If he maintains this trajectory, he could find himself hosting the Globes \u2013 and that would really cement his position in Hollywood.\u2019 Corden, 36, who made his name as co-writer and star of cult television sitcom Gavin and Stacey, has already proved his ability to host a major awards show by fronting the Brits for four years. If he took on the Globes, he would be following in the footsteps of fellow comedy actor Ricky Gervais, who hosted the ceremony from 2010 to 2012. Since Gervais stepped down, the awards have been co-hosted by American TV comedy stars Tina Fey and Amy Poehler. Comfortable: \u2018James has shown that he\u2019s funny, can sing and dance, puts celebrities at their ease,' said a source. Pictured with Patricia Arqeutte and Chris Pine on his second night . A source within the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which stages the Golden Globes, said: \u2018Amy and Tina have finished their three-year contract and have stated that they won\u2019t be back next year. \u2018Right now, the field for a new Golden Globes host is wide open.\u2019 Another insider said: \u2018James Corden combines all the attributes of the ideal host. \u2018He has enjoyed movie success this year, starring in Into The Woods with Meryl Streep, and of course he\u2019s had TV success in Britain with his comedies. \u2018He\u2019s also won a Tony for his Broadway show One Man, Two Guvnors, and now he\u2019s getting rave reviews in the States with The Late Late Show, giving him an international audience.\u2019 While there are a string of chat show hosts who are better known in America, such as David Letterman, Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel and Ellen DeGeneres, none has Corden\u2019s wide range of film, TV and stage success. Corden\u2019s guests during his debut week included actors Tom Hanks, Mila Kunis, Will Ferrell, Chris Pine and Kevin Hart. Celebrities lined up for future shows include X Factor tycoon Simon Cowell, footballer David Beckham, chef Gordon Ramsay and actors Michael Douglas, Courteney Cox and Claire Danes. But not everyone might welcome Corden as the Globes host. He sparked controversy at the Brits in 2012 when he cut short Adele\u2019s acceptance speech for winning the Best British Album after only 12 seconds, provoking a vulgar hand gesture from the angry singer. Theo Kingma, president of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, said: \u2018We are exploring some very exciting possibilities regarding hosts.\u2019 A spokesman for Corden declined to comment.",

Flam, a cat in Nashville, Tennessee, may well be the first of its kind to have had a conversation with a human being. But sadly, as documented on video, the little chat didn't go down that well with the feline. In the clip is Penny Adams, a professional photographer who volunteers her time at the Cat Shoppe Rescue centre. Sitting on the floor, she announces to the camera that she is holding a cat-to-human language translator on her phone. Penny, who doesn't herself know what it is being translated by the app, activates the meowing sound and immediately Flam, who sits underneath a table, becomes noticeably intrigued. Penny announces to the camera that she is about to use a cat-to-human translator app on her phone . Jumping up, the feline negotiates a number of dumbbells on the floor before making its way towards Penny. With its tail poised, the cat maintains its eye-contact while lifting its paw and climbing up onto her leg. Suddenly it lashes out at her \u2013 opening its mouth to bare its teeth it strikes her with its paw. Intrigued, the cat approaches Penny with its tail poised and begins slowly climbing up her leg . Reacting by blocking the cat with her arm, Penny laughs in surprise as the insulted feline continues to bare its teeth before scuttling off. According to Penny, she had visited Kate Framke's home \u2013 Flam\u2019s owner \u2013 to photograph her other cat  Waffles for a fundraising calendar for The Cat Shoppe. After struggling to get Waffles\u2019 attention with toys and treats, Penny used her human-to-cat translator app as a way of getting the cat to look at the camera. The cat, clearly insulted by what the human-to-cat translator app is saying, attacks Penny with its paw . Penny said: \u2018It worked, but it also got an unusual reaction from Flam, who proceeded to walk up slowly and pop me in the head. We laughed so hard.\u2019 She added: \u2018Who knows what the app was really saying in cat voice, but he sure didn't like it.\u2019 The Cat Shoppe is Nashville\u2019s first feline-friendly shop that sells a number of cat-related products and also runs a non-profit cat rescue centre.

        "document": "A suspended Roman Catholic priest who authorities say dealt pounds of methamphetamine and bought a sex shop to possibly launder his drug money is asking a federal judge for leniency when he is sentenced next week. Monsignor Kevin Wallin's public defender filed a sentencing request in federal court in Hartford on Monday citing Wallin's three decades of charitable service as well as more than 80 letters of support, including one from the late New York Cardinal Edward Egan. Wallin, 63, dubbed 'Monsignor Meth', pleaded guilty in 2013 to a methamphetamine conspiracy charge and agreed to a potential prison sentence of 10 to 11 years. Kevin Wallin, 63, dubbed 'Monsignor Meth', pleaded guilty in 2013 to a methamphetamine conspiracy charge and agreed to a potential prison sentence of 10 to 11 years . Already imprisoned for the past two years, he is now asking for a sentence of no more than four years in prison followed by a year of home confinement, 500 hours of community service and drug treatment. Sentencing is scheduled for March 24. 'The record evidence demonstrates that Kevin Wallin is an extraordinary man whose remarkable character and acts have touched thousands of people,' Wallin's public defender, Kelly Barrett, wrote in the sentencing request. 'Kevin tragically became a methamphetamine addict. He fell from grace and did criminal wrong, but has confessed his crimes and has been working hard to atone for them.' Barrett wrote that Wallin's numerous accomplishments include serving as pastor of St. Peter's Parish in Danbury and the Cathedral Parish in Bridgeport, volunteering with a variety of community groups, helping found an AIDS ministry program, leading an inner city charity group, serving on the Danbury Cultural Commission and serving on the board of directors of Sacred Heart University. Egan, who died earlier this month, was bishop of the Diocese of Bridgeport from 1988 to 2000. He praised Wallin in a letter to the court. Wallin bought the Land of Oz & Dorothy's Place adult video and sex toy shop in North Haven and had apparently intended to launder drug proceeds . 'He was outstanding in the fulfillment of his assignments and in his concern for people in need,' Egan wrote. 'Father Wallin was held in highest regard as a dedicated clergyman and an outstanding citizen as well.' Federal prosecutors say Wallin committed serious crimes and most people convicted of conspiring to sell meth are sentenced to at least 10 years in prison. Federal investigators said Wallin had associates in California send him methamphetamine beginning in late 2008 or early 2009. By 2011, Wallin's partners were sending him one to three pounds of meth a month and Wallin was running the drug operation out of his apartment in Waterbury, investigators said. Wallin also bought the 'Land of Oz & Dorothy's Place' adult video and sex toy shop in North Haven and apparently intended to launder drug proceeds that totaled in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, federal agents said in court documents. Wallin served as the pastor at St. Augustine's in Bridgeport for nine years before taking a sabbatical in 2011 for health and personal reasons . Wallin's two accomplices in California \u2014 Chad McCluskey of San Clemente and Kristen Laschober of Laguna Niguel \u2014 were both sentenced last year to five years in prison. Two men who helped Wallin sell drugs in Connecticut also were convicted. Kenneth Devries of Waterbury was sentenced to more than two years in prison and Michael Nelson of Manchester awaits sentencing. Brian Wallace, a spokesman for the Diocese of Bridgeport, said Wallin is still a priest, but remains suspended from public ministry. 'We're asking for prayers for him, understanding and recognizing that many people ... suffer from addiction and they lose control of their lives,' Wallace said. 'It's time for him to try to rebuild his life.'",

Tech blogger Kenneth Tsang extracted all the movies and TV shows on offer in each country and put them in a spreadsheet, finding 1,116 titles in Australia compared with 8,499 in the U.S. A Netflix spokesman said the libraries vary from country to country, adding that they change every day. 'Our aim in Australia is not to replicate the American library,' he told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . Netflix has officially launched in Australia but its local offering carries 7,000 fewer titles than its U.S. version . 'As our library grows, we're collecting data and we can tailor our content as we spend more time in market because we understand what Australians are watching.' The spokesman added that content distribution deals prevented Netflix from carrying certain titles in Australia. 'That's purely down to distribution rights, many programs get snapped up by other services. 'Our goal is to work towards a global model, when that happens we will be negotiating rights on a global scale.' Mr Tsang also found that Netflix has 693 titles available only to Australian viewers. On Monday Netflix officially outlined its pricing scheme, and confirmed  House Of Cards and Orange Is The New Black would be among its key TV shows on offer. The service launches on Tuesday charging $8.99 per month for a single screen (standard definition), $11.99 for two screens (high definition) and $14.99 for ultra definition on four screens.

The launch of Netflix ushers in what is arguably the biggest change to the Australian TV landscape in decades. But the online streaming services will still have to convince Australians - who are among the most prolific illegal downloaders in the world - to pay for content. This could prove difficult, with a new Canstar Blue survey finding that the majority of Australians are still not willing to pay for TV content. Around one in five are willing to pay up to $20 a month for a service that provides a majority of content they would like to see. But this could change in future, with the survey also finding that 23 per cent of young Australians are already utilising online streaming services like Stan, Presto, Quickflix and Netflix.

        "document": "He's better known for his fancy footwork on the pitch but Liverpool and England striker Daniel Sturridge took time out of scoring goals to get some kitchen action. The 25-year-old Birmingham lad was taken through his culinary paces by his mother Grace, who taught him how to make her favourite dish ahead of Mother's Day. And like her Reds son, mum Grace is a fan of healthy eating and requested the Kop ace to create a high protein meal of spicy grilled chicken with seasoned quinoa and vegetables. Scroll down for video. Daniel Sturridge and kisses his mother Grace after he successfully cooks spicy chicken with quinoa and vegetables as part of his Mother's Day Challenge . The 25-year-old Birmingham lad in action on the pitch, competing with Alex Baptise of Blackburn Rovers during the FA Cup Quarter Final match on Sunday 8 March . The duo joined forces in the kitchen as part of a Sainsbury's Active Kids event at a school in St Paul's RC Junior School, Liverpool. Daniel, who cooks his own meals every day, told FEMAIL: My mum is amazing, she has provided me with so much support and continues to do so always. 'To spoil my mum I would probably cook her something healthy with a bit of spice to it, fish based maybe. 'Mum loves nice salads and especially avocado, so would definitely include that.' For the challenge the Sainsbury's Active Kids ambassador had to prepare quinoa - \u00a0which is a superfood favourite of the family - and marinate the chicken with Grace's home-made spicy 'Sturrcrazy' sauce, made to a secret family recipe. The pair cook together when they can although these days it's becoming rarer. Grace said to FEMAIL: 'When we can we like to cook together, but it doesn't happen so often these days, as Daniel lives away from home. Mother and son work together and start off by seasoning the chicken with a mixture of spices . As the chicken marinades the pair chop the vegetables and prepare the rest of the meal . What was Daniel like as a child? Daniel has always been really active, he played football in and out of school. At home he would play out whatever the weather! Because of his naturally active lifestyle, he always loved meal times and eating Afro-Caribbean food. As our family were all sporty and active, it was natural for us to promote healthy eating and a healthy lifestyle. Does he still have the same tastes? Yes still loves it, amongst other things! But Daniel loves anything with spice to it. What is his favourite food? I would say he has two favourite dishes, fish and chicken. The white meat is full of protein so is really good for him and he loves to be able to make both chicken and fish in to spicy dishes, which is why he loves our family's Sturr Crazy sauce. If he was cooking for you, what would he cook? Probably salmon with sweet potatoes and garlic thyme chopped up and cooked in the oven. It's quite an easy dish to make and it's really tasty. He would probably make a side salad with rocket, tomatoes and lots of avocado, he knows I love avocado! What does Daniel mean to you? All of the family are so proud of what Daniel has achieved so far, he gave up so much as a child and we are just so happy that he is achieving his dream, as parents you couldn't wish for more than that for your children! But she still tries to get her family together at weekends. 'Every Sunday we still try and get together as a family and have a typical Afro-Caribbean lunch of spicy meat, rice and peas. 'We love getting together and think it's important to spend that time together,' she continued. Famous for being a proponent of superfoods after his 2014 calf injury saw him miss 13 matches, Daniel now incorporates as much nutrient-packed foods into his diet as he can. 'It's important for me to make sure that I eat a healthy balanced diet as obviously I'm training every day,'he said. 'I do enjoy cooking and I look forward to my dinner each night.' His favourite meal to cook is 'salmon, kale, sweet potato, broccoli and quinoa' which he covers in Sturr Crazy sauce. 'I have it on everything,'he said. 'It adds that perfect amount of spice to a dish; I even took some out to the World Cup with me.' A typical day will see him pack away three scrambled eggs with berries for breakfast whilst lunch and dinner are heavy on protein-rich foods . 'Lunch and dinner could be quite similar to each other with something like quinoa, with perhaps chicken or fish [as] they are both great for recovery and full of protein,' he said. 'On the side I would have broccoli, spinach, lots of steamed veg. I also drink a lot of white tea and moringa tea throughout the day,' he continued. So far so healthy, but doesn't he have any guilty food secrets? 'I'm pretty good with my diet to be honest, I love healthy food which helps and it is something I have worked on for years. But every now and then you need something sweet, which is fine, but all in moderation,' he said. And does he dance in the kitchen when he's successfully cooked a meal? 'Haha I leave the dancing for on the pitch,' he laughed. Tara Hewitt, Head of Sponsorship for Sainsbury's said: 'It was great to see Daniel and Grace cooking together at the event; they clearly have a passion for great tasting, healthy food.' Result! Daniel and Grace with the finished meal, spicy chicken served with quinoa and steamed veg . Ingredients: Four chicken thighs (skin and boneless); 220g quinoa; four spring onions; one sweet red pepper; two cloves fresh garlic; four medium carrots; one broccoli floret; four spears of asparagus; black pepper, all spice, paprika; dark soy sauce; olive oil . Mehod: Season the chicken with all spice, black pepper, paprika and dark soy sauce and leave to marinate overnight. Pre-heat the oven to 400*F and back chicken for approx 30 mins until golden and cooked through. Splash on some SturrCrazy sauce (or other spicy condiment) and return to the oven for five minutes. Rinse the quinoa thoroughly and place on a high heat with a pinch of salt. Bring to the boil then turn down to simmer for 20 mins until steamed and fluffy then set aside. Whilst the quinoa is steaming, finely chop the onions a quarter of the sweet pepper, two cloves of garlic and pan fry with a splash of olive oil, pepper and season all. Empty and toss the cooked quinoa in with the onions and mix together, adding more seasoning if needed. Peel and chop the carrots, chop the broccoli, trim the asparagus and steam in a pan for five minutes until tender before plating up.",

        "document": "Relentless\u00a0Robbie Neilson  celebrated Hearts clinching the Championship title in March \u2014 then ordered his team to smash Hibs\u2019 second-tier record points total. An unexpected 2-0 win for Rangers at Easter Road yesterday left the Tynecastle side \u2014 who had beaten Falkirk 3-0 at Westfield 24 hours earlier \u2014 an unassailable 23 points clear of Hibs with 21 points left on the board. Neilson learned his team had secured a return to the Premiership without kicking a ball while he was studying for his pro licence at Stirling University yesterday afternoon. Robbie Neilson wants his Hearts team to surpass Hibernian's second-tier points total . Hearts ended up securing their title a day after a 3-0 win against Falkirk . Rangers beat Hibernian to give Hearts an unassailable advantage at the top of the league . But, despite the league being finally in the bag, the 34-year-old vowed there will be no let-up as Hearts hope to usurp Hibs\u2019 record tally of 89 points, set under Alex McLeish in 1999. Should his team rise to his challenge of winning their remaining seven matches, the rampant Gorgie outfit would end the season with a remarkable 99 points. \u2018It\u2019s a fantastic achievement to win the league. It\u2019s a great day for the club,\u2019 said Neilson. \u2018The objective for the season was to get promoted. We\u2019ve done that and that will give us a head start in planning for next season \u2014 but we need to keep winning games. \u2018We\u2019ve got seven games left and we want maximum points. We won\u2019t be losing focus. If we could set a new record for points for the division, then that would be fantastic. \u2018When you play for a club with the stature of Hearts, you have to keep winning games \u2014 and that\u2019s what we need to do. \u2018I will rotate the squad and some guys will get game time but you have to win games. We can\u2019t be turning up at venues and losing games. We want to win, starting with three more points against Queen of the South at Tynecastle next weekend.\u2019 Neilson believes his side\u2019s 2-1 stoppage-time win at Ibrox against Rangers on the opening day of the season set the tone for a fine campaign. But it wasn\u2019t until a battling 2-1 victory at Queen of the South on February 21 that he truly believed his side was destined to win the league and return to the top flight after one season away. \u2018I don\u2019t think you ever take things for granted until you are over the line,\u2019 he said. \u2018But I think that Queen of the South game was a big one for us away from home. We went a goal behind and we had to fight back to get all three points. We eventually got there and, from then on, I thought we had a real chance of taking the league. \u2018But that win against Rangers on the opening day was a huge one for us in terms of morale and also for our fans. A lot of times you can go to Ibrox, go ahead and then Rangers draw level and you\u2019re then hoping to hang on for a draw. Hearts' Genero Zeefuik celebrates after giving his side two-goal lead against Falkirk . The Hearts players celebrate as they beat Falkirk and edged closer to an impressive title win . \u2018But we went straight up the park and scored again to get all three points and that set the tone for the whole season. It gave us a real belief we could go on to win the trophy and now we\u2019ve done it. \u2018To finally get over the line is magnificent. The players have worked so hard and I couldn\u2019t have asked for more. \u2018We can now speak to players we want to get from outside the club and speak to players at the club and try to renegotiate. We\u2019ve got guys who have been fantastic for us and we want to keep hold of them. \u2018It\u2019s just a great day and it\u2019s testament to the support we\u2019ve had all season from the fans, the hard work of (owner) Ann Budge and (director of football) Craig Levein and all the players. \u2018The fans in particular have been magnificent and they deserve to have a great night and a great few weeks.\u2019 Meanwhile, Hearts captain Danny Wilson admitted it was a relief to finally get over the line after months of being billed as champions-in-waiting. Hearts captain Danny Wilson revealed his joy after his side became Scottish Championship winners . \u2018It has been difficult, you know,\u2019 he said. \u2018Since maybe late December and early January people have had us installed as champions. So it\u2019s been tough, not so much to keep your standards up but to put all that talk to one side. But we\u2019ve done that. \u2018The way the season has panned out, we\u2019ve been going about our business in the right fashion. But if you had asked me at the start of the season whether I thought the gap would have been this big, I probably wouldn\u2019t have believed you.\u2019",

The Old Trafford boss has been testing his players\u2019 temperaments by giving incorrect decisions in training matches to wind them up.

        "document": "Ella Draper (pictured) and her partner Abraham Christie forced her two children to lie about sexual abuse and ritual torture . An evil\u00a0mother tortured her children to make up sickening allegations about a satanic cult based at a primary school in the midst of a seething child contact dispute, a High Court judge ruled yesterday. Ella Draper and her partner Abraham Christie forced her two children to lie about sexual abuse and ritual torture in Hampstead, North London, Mrs Justice Pauffley said. She named and shamed the pair in a written ruling on care proceedings brought by a local council and said their internet campaign about the cult was \u2018evil\u2019 and \u2018baseless\u2019. The judge suggested the couple may have fed the two youngsters, aged eight and nine, cannabis soup to gain their compliance. More than four million people worldwide have viewed the \u2018fantasy\u2019 online material and police had to protect worried parents at the gates of Christchurch Primary School where the \u2018main action\u2019 was alleged to have happened, the ruling said. The \u2018grotesque\u2019 claims against \u2018blameless\u2019 people included drugged babies being sent from abroad by courier services such as TNT and DHL to London and then sacrificed. Cult members were said to have drunk their victims\u2019 blood and danced around with the babies\u2019 skulls. At least seven other schools were named, a swimming pool identified as a meeting place and \u2018rituals\u2019 were alleged to have been performed at a McDonald\u2019s fast food restaurant. The children\u2019s father Ricky Dearman, whose three-year relationship with Draper ended acrimoniously in 2006, was falsely said to be the leader of the cult, and teachers, police and a priest to be among its more than 100 members. The judge said: \u2018Many of those individuals are now living in fear because they have been identified on the internet as abusers of children and their contact details including telephone numbers, home and email addresses have been published. \u2018Several of those implicated have received malicious, intimidating phone calls and emails at all hours of the day and night from all over the world. For example \u2013 \u201cWe\u2019re coming for you. You paedo scum\u201d.\u2019 The two children, who are now in care, were repeatedly named in the internet campaign and films of them uploaded to the internet \u2018with flagrant disregard for their welfare interests\u2019. Mrs Justice Pauffley was asked to investigate by social services bosses in care proceedings brought by Barnet council after the two children were said to be at the centre of the cult\u2019s abuse. But the judge said they were in fact forced by Draper and Christie to \u2018provide concocted accounts of horrific events\u2019 in filmed mobile phone recordings and to lie to police when interviewed after the allegations were brought to the attention of officers in September last year. The children\u2019s stories came about as the result of \u2018relentless emotional and psychological pressure as well as significant physical abuse\u2019. Internet campaign: More than four million people worldwide have viewed the \u2018fantasy\u2019 online material . \u2018Torture is a strong word but is the most accurate way to describe what was done to the children by Christie in collaboration with Draper,\u2019 the judge said. \u2018Both P and Q have suffered significantly. Their innocence was invaded. Their minds were scrambled. Their grip on reality was imperilled.\u2019 Tests showed they had both also ingested cannabis in the three months before being taken into care. It was impossible for analysts to say if this was via passive smoking or oral ingestion, but both children had described in interview how hemp was made into soup at their home using the juicer, the judge said. Draper took no part in the court proceedings and has \u2018not been seen by anyone in authority since February 12\u2019. There are \u2018rumours that she has fled abroad\u2019 because she fears being arrested, Mrs Justice Pauffley said. The judge completely cleared Mr Dearman and all others named in the campaign of any abuse and called the material published on the internet \u2018nothing more than utter nonsense\u2019. \u2018I am entirely certain that everything Ms Draper, her partner Abraham Christie and the children said about those matters was fabricated,\u2019 she said. \u2018The claims are baseless. Those who have sought to perpetrate them are evil and or foolish. \u2018All the signs are that those responsible for posting material derive a great deal of personal satisfaction from attracting interest to their spiteful work from many thousands of people. \u2018It\u2019s akin to the sensation, I imagine, of a Facebook user receiving an indication that some posting or other has been liked.\u2019",

        "document": "England\u2019s seven-game winning streak does not include Italy. Lithuania, but not Italy. Slovenia, but not Italy. San Marino and Estonia, but not Italy. So the idea that the heat has been taken out of Harry Kane\u2019s full debut for his country by a string of victories since last summer\u2019s World Cup does rather overlook a salient fact. That England\u2019s seven wins, as welcome as they may be, are against the also-rans of European football. Only Slovenia are on course to qualify automatically for the European Championship at the halfway stage \u2014 by coming a distant second to England \u2014 while Norway, Switzerland and Scotland are in third place in their respective groups, Lithuania lie fourth, Estonia fifth and San Marino where they always are. This is not Roy Hodgson\u2019s fault. His players can only beat what is in front of them. Tottenham striker Harry Kane is set to make his full England debut against Italy on Tuesday night . Kane celebrates after scoring on his England debut against Lithuania just 79 seconds after coming on . Kane looks on as England manager Roy Hodgson talks to members of the squad at the Juventus Stadium . Yet just as Hodgson is trying to play down the clamour around Kane, playing down the euphoria around England\u2019s present run may be equally wise. It is not a year since England\u2019s poorest World Cup finals performance in recent memory and what we do know is that when a group of players that are the scourge of the Baltic nations plus an odd mountain range or two came up against Italy in Manaus last June, they did not have the wit to win. That is where Kane comes in. Italy and England may be depleted in Turin, but certain standards remain. Italy\u2019s defence will be of a calibre England have not experienced since the World Cup. Their ambition will be greater than that of previous opponents, too. The Spurs striker headed in against Lithuania  shortly after coming on as a substitute at Wembley . Kane celebrates his first international goal as England cruised to a 4-0 win over lowly Lithunania . This is a genuine test for Kane, in a way his cameo role against Lithuania wasn\u2019t. He will not have played against a team of Lithuania\u2019s standard since he was being farmed out by his club on loan to gain experience. Lithuania fielded a starting back four featuring players from Rangers, Hapoel Haifa, Zalgiris Vilnius and Cambuur of Holland. On Tuesday, he will play against two of the men who have powered Juventus to the pinnacle of Italian football \u2014 Giorgio Chiellini and Leonardo Bonucci \u2014 plus Andrea Ranocchia of Inter Milan. It is an upgrade. And that is what England require of Kane, too: an upgrade. Hodgson knows he already has the players to qualify for a major tournament \u2014 but he didn\u2019t have ones who could muscle past Italy or Uruguay once there. The hope is Kane could change that. Kane will come up against Italy and Juventus defender Leonardo Bonucci (left) on Tuesday night . Giorgio Chiellini (second right), pictured with his Italy team-mates, will also come up against the England man . Italy players train at the Juventus Stadium in Turin ahead of Tuesday's friendly against England . At the moment we are left asking questions to which we probably know the answer. Why is Danny Welbeck so prolific for England \u2014 Europe\u2019s top scorer in the current qualifying campaign, no less \u2014 yet still finding his feet with Arsenal? Why is Raheem Sterling\u2019s form so inconsistent for Liverpool, yet so vital for England? The explanation can be found in that Lithuanian back four. When does Welbeck get to play against defenders at the level of the Scottish Championship with Arsenal? When does Sterling face opposition such as Cambuur? Danny Welbeck, top scorer in Euro qualifying, celebrates with Wayne Rooney after scoring on Friday night . Raheem Sterling comes up against better quality opposition for Liverpool than when playing for England . Chelsea send their promising youth-team players to Vitesse Arnhem on loan, and they often make the first team. Vitesse are currently fifth in the Eredivisie; Cambuur are 10th. The last time they met, on February 4, two Chelsea players featured for Vitesse, who won 2-0. So that is what Welbeck and England were up against on Friday \u2014 defenders who might not quite be at the level of Chelsea\u2019s best youngsters. Faced with John Terry in the Premier League, different rules apply. Yet against Terry on January 1, Kane nhad one of his best games of the season. Kane had one of his best games of the  season against John Terry during Spurs' 5-3 win over Chelsea . He is English football\u2019s top scorer playing often against players with the quality we shall witness on Tuesday night. What Hodgson must be hoping is that in Turin he sees a player who can take England beyond. Wayne Rooney was Europe\u2019s top scorer on the way to South Africa in 2010, too. Having qualified, England failed to attain the necessary level when competing in the finals. Hodgson talked of Kane on Monday as a squad player being given the chance to show what he can do \u2014 albeit with one of his most promising lines of supply severed as Sterling is back on Merseyside nursing a minor injury. Yet he is more than just that. If Kane demonstrates that he can pose a genuine threat to high- level defenders, he has the capability to change the way England approach matches. The Premier League's top scorer will be up against defenders of real quality when England take on Italy . Welbeck does a job for Hodgson, but that is what it is: a job. It is a good job \u2014 he is the player Hodgson relies upon when he is concerned the opposition has superior technique \u2014 but it has limitations. Welbeck works hard, he closes down, he has pace on the counter-attack \u2014 and he does exactly what the manager asks of him. And, for now, that is enough. Welbeck has been prolific as England power through the mediocrities. Welbeck does a good job and is often relied on by Hodgson when England face sides with superior technique . Extra is needed in France in 2016, however, if England are to be more than just present. Hodgson must discover match-winners, players who have the beating of contenders like Italy. So Tuesday night is much more than a friendly for Kane. This is a moment when he has the opportunity to alter the potential of English football and, if successful, we shouldn\u2019t be frightened to embrace this.",

        "document": "Children of smokers may be up to four times more likely to develop heart disease later in life. And the dangers still exist even if smokers try and limit their child's exposure to secondhand smoke, researchers warn. Therefore, the only way to protect children is to not smoke at all, they say. The findings confirm previous research that linked tobacco smoke and toxins with a lasting effect on children's cardiovascular health. The new research confirms tobacco smoke and toxins have a lasting effect on children's heart health . Finnish children were measured for their exposure to passive smoking and whether their carotid arteries - the blood vessels that carry oxygen-rich blood to the head, brain and face - had become narrowed or blocked due to plaque build-up in adulthood. Plaque buildup is made up of fatty deposits and other cells that can build up in the walls of the arteries over time, making them thicker (and therefore harder for blood to flow) As plaque continues to build, it can actually narrow or begin to clog arteries. This slow plaque buildup in arteries over time is a progressive disease called atherosclerosis. The study involved children whose blood samples were taken in in 1980 and 1983 as part in the Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study. In 2001 and 2007, ultrasound readings of their carotid arteries were taken. Then in 2014, Finnish researchers measured the participant's childhood blood cotinine levels from samples collected and frozen in 1980. Cotinine is a biomarker of passive smoke exposure. The researchers found that 84 per cent of children from households where neither parent smoked had non-detectable cotinine levels in their samples. However, only 62 per cent of children from households where one parent smoked and 43 per cent of children from households where both parents smoked had blood samples with non-detectable cotinine levels. The dangers still exist even if smokers try and limit their child's exposure to secondhand smoke, the researchers warn. Therefore, the only way to protect children is to not smoke at all . The risk of developing carotid plaque in adulthood was almost two times (1.7) higher in children who had one or both parents who smoked, compared to children of non-smoking parents. And the risk was elevated even if parents tried to limit their children's exposure, warned the study, published in the  journal Circulation. Children whose parents smoked but didn't limit exposure had almost twice the risk - and those fiull exposed had four times the risk, the study found. Study author Dr Costan Magnussen, of the University of Turku, said: 'Although we cannot confirm that children with a detectable blood cotinine in our study was a result of passive smoke exposure directly from their parents, we know that a child's primary source of passive smoke exposure occurs at home. 'For parents who are trying to quit smoking, they may be able to reduce some of the potential long-term risk for their children by actively reducing their children's exposure to secondhand smoke, by not smoking inside the home, car, or smoke well away from their children. 'However not smoking at all is by far the safest option'. Repeated exposure of children to secondhand smoke is child abuse, a leading doctor has warned. Adam Goldstein, a professor in family medicine, says exposure is as abusive as leaving children unattended in hot car, or drink driving. He claims he was forced to speak out after caring for 'too many children hospitalised with asthma and pneumonia, caused in large part to their repeated exposure to secondhand smoke'. Dr Goldsteimn argues that purposefully and repeatedly exposing children to a something known to cause cancer in humans would strike many people as child abuse . His controversial opinion piece has been published in the latest issue of the Annals of Family Medicine. In it, he argues that purposefully and repeatedly exposing children to a something known to cause cancer in humans would strike many people as child abuse. 'But what if the substance is secondhand smoke?,' he asks. Dr Goldstein, who is director of the tobacco intervention programs in the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, says the damage from smoke is 'as abusive as many other commonly accepted physical and emotional traumas of children'. His comments come after years of caring for children who have suffered severe respiratory illness due to secondhand smoke exposure. In the opinion piece, he writes: 'Scientific research over the last decade has increasingly demonstrated that exposure to secondhand smoke is not simply a nuisance; it is deadly. 'Secondhand smoke exposure causes multiple diseases in children, including asthma and pneumonia, and results in thousands of avoidable hospitalisations. 'It is a major cause of sudden infant death syndrome and may cause lung cancer and heart attacks with repeated exposure. He argues that purposefully and repeatedly exposing children to a something known to cause cancer in humans would strike many people as child abuse . 'No safe level of exposure exists . '[Therefore], purposefully and recurrently exposing children to secondhand smoke - a known human carcinogen - despite repeated warnings, is child abuse.'",

Jimmy Thoronka carrying the Commonwealth baton in Sierra Leone. He has been arrested for overstaying his visa and claims all his immediate family are dead from Ebola so he cannot return home . When Thoronka, the country's number one 100m sprinter, left Sierra Leone for Glasgow, some Ebola cases had been confirmed in a few of the villages surrounding Freetown, but the epidemic had not yet taken hold of the capital. The death toll in the country is now more than 3,500 cases. The runner said: 'I was hoping to win a medal for my country. But during the Games I got the terrible news that my uncle had died, probably from Ebola. 'I couldn't stop crying. It was difficult to continue with competing but I tried to carry on.' He is not working illegally, nor claiming benefits or housing, and understands the legal implications of remaining in the UK after his visa has expired, but said his situation is hopeless. After the Games, he stayed for a while with friends in Leicester - and found out that his entire immediate family had been killed by Ebola. Later he went to London and began sleeping in parks and on night buses and begging for \u00a31 from passers-by to buy chips. Hampden Park in Glasgow was the venue for the track and field events during the Commonwealth Games . 'Some days I get no food at all. I wash in public toilets and sleep in the park,' he said. 'I wake up around 4am and if I've got a bus pass I get on the night bus and sleep there until morning. 'I met a man who sometimes lets me sleep at his house but I have to wait outside for him to come home at 10 or 11pm and I get very cold. 'We have a cold season in Sierra Leone but it is not cold like England. Some days I don't think I'm going to make it and just feel like killing myself. 'My dream is to become one of the best sprinters in the world but I don't see how that can happen now.' The newspaper said hundreds of people have been in touch to offer support, and a petition has been set up on change.org to support him.

        "document": "(CNN)It's the home of British politics, steeped in history, tradition and centuries-old pomp. But could the ornate splendor of the UK's Houses of Parliament be about to offer a solution to London's housing crisis? In all honesty, probably not. However, that hasn't stopped housing campaign group, Generation Rent, from proposing to transform the Palace of Westminster into affordable new homes. The group's eye-catching idea is to move the seat of British democracy from one of London's most exclusive neighborhoods to a new location in the city of Hull, northern England. The vacant House of Commons and House of Lords (the UK's upper legislative chamber) left behind would be converted into 364 flats of varying size and scale with prime office space facing the River Thames. According to a press release on the proposal from Generation Rent, 335 MPs from all over the UK currently rent second homes so they can carry out their parliamentary duties more effectively. They claim expenses for doing so cost the taxpayer \u00a35.26 million ($8 million) in 2013 alone. By moving the seat of government to Hull, a city with the cheapest housing rent in England, millions could be saved in expenses as well as staffing costs, the group claims. Westminster is one of the most expensive boroughs for property in London, according to research from house moving firm, Delivery Quote Compare. The ever-rising cost of property in the UK capital, meanwhile, is making it increasingly difficult for many to buy or rent in central areas of the city. A January report from rental referencing company, Homelet, also found that average rental prices in Greater London were more than double that of those found in the rest of the UK . \"We hope our proposal gives MPs a sense of humility and some urgency to ending the housing crisis,\" said director of Generation Rent, Alex Hilton. Yet even if the Generation Rent proposals were seriously considered, they could come unstuck by the dilapidated state of the parliament building itself. Speaker of the House, John Bercow, said Monday that repairs needed to bring the nineteenth century structure up to scratch could come close to \u00a33 billion ($4.6 billion). A 2012 study entitled \"The Restorations and Renewal of the Palace of Westminster\" found that the building could suffer permanent damage if work was not undertaken to stem leaks, repair crumbling stonework and remove asbestos.",

        "document": "Hillary Clinton's emails won't likely turn up many insights about the 2012 Benghazi terror attacks, according to a onetime Clinton confidant, because she can't type. Dick Morris, who helped President Bill Clinton navigate domestic policy and led his 1996 re-election effort before imploding in his own 'bimbo eruption' scandal, wrote Monday on his blog that Mrs. Clinton 'doesn\u2019t know how to type.' 'That\u2019s right. She writes everything out in longhand. Really. Anyone who has spent time in meetings with her knows about her endless yellow pads.' Morris' insights, although dated, came as the former secretary of state visited the White House for a rare sit-down with President Barack Obama. Hillary Clinton visited the White House on Monday and tweeted this old photo of her hugging President Obama, while a former aide to her husband compared her email scandal to the Watergate tapes and said the Obama team likely created it to torpedo her chances in 2016 . PRESSURE: Clinton is facing tough questions about what's on a private email server that hosted all her emails for the four years she spent as America's top diplomat . Former Clinton insidder Dick Morris has turned against Hillary, dishing dirt about her past and suggesting what her weak spots might be . 'Her emails will most likely turn out to be very short and quick,' he predicted. 'She wouldn\u2019t spend a lot of time pecking out long letters. No way. That\u2019s why the Benghazi Committee needs to also look very closely at the emails on private accounts that Hillary\u2019s closest aides, Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills, maintained.' 'Anything more than a few lines were most likely written by someone else on her behalf,' Morris continued. 'There\u2019s a reason why Hillary set up and used private emails with them for official business: all the important emails were likely written by her staff. Without access to them, we won\u2019t know what was going on.' A congressional panel is investigating the circumstances surrounding a 2012 terror attack on State Department facilities in Benghazi, Libya, while Clinton was secretary of state. The revelation that she exclusively used a private email account \u2013 otuside the control or automatic archiving of the Obama administration \u2013 has fed Republican accusations that she hid her involvement in a post-attack cover-up in the weeks before the 2012 election. At least two aides, Mills and Abedin, used personal email accounts on Clinton's private server, kept at her Chappaqua, New York home. Clinton's hour-long White House visit on Monday followed her appearance on a Washington, D.C. domestic policy panel hosted by the far-left Center for American Progress, and before she headlined an awards ceremony for journalists. She took no questions from reporters at the evening event, even though her unauthorized private email server has dominated news coverage, her aides are under subpoena and she is expected to launch a presidential campaign in the coming weeks. At the earlier liberal event, she endorsed a German-style system of subsidies to companies so they would keep more people employed. 'President Obama and Secretary Clinton enjoy catching up in . person when their schedules permit,' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Monday in a cryptic statement to reporters. 'This afternoon they met privately for about an hour at the . White House and discussed a range of topics.' Moments after the White House confirmed the meeting, Clinton tweeted an old photo of her hugging Obama in the White House Situation Room. The president has had a frosty relationship with his former top diplomat since 2008 when thetwo squared off for the Democratic presidential nomination. IT'S THE AIDES, STUPID! Email accounts of former State Department Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills (left) and her top deputy Huma Abedin (right) are where Benghazi-related emails likely lurk, says Dick Morris . THE ADDRESS: Abedin had an email address on the former secretary of state's private server, judging from records maintained by Lexis-Nexis . Clinton damaged his ambitious quest for the brass ring by starting the rumors that he was born in Kenya and lacked a valid U.S. birth certificate. The resulting conspiracy theories have dogged his presidency since Day One. Clinton's Twitter message, though, defended key provisions of the president's signature health insurance overhaul, which was an extension of her own failed attempt at reform while her husband was president. 'Repeal those things? Embrace them!' she tweeted. Morris has a checkered past. He famously resigned from Bill Clinton's 1996 campaign two months before Election Day after it was revealed that he paid a prostitute for sex and let her listen in on his phone calls with the president. His most recent star turn came with a lengthy Fox News Channel contract which wasn't renewed after he spectacularly blew his forecast for the 2012 presidential contest. Mitt Romney, the once famous pollster predicted, would coast to victory and unseat Obama. But Morris has been a thorn in Hillary's side since being bounced from her orbit in 1996. YUK-YUK: Clinton joked about her email scandal on Monday night at a journalism award dinnner: ''No more secrecy, no more zone of privacy. After all, what good did that do me?' When she ran for president in 2008, he penned a vicious 'fact check'\u00a0article claiming that her 'main extra-curricular activity in law school was helping the Black Panthers, on trial in Connecticut for torturing and killing a federal agent.'

        "document": "Council worker Maria Spruce, 40, spent \u00a33,500 of taxpayers' money on iPads, phones a laptop for her 'spoilt' son . A disgraced\u00a0council worker who used taxpayers' cash to go on a \u00a33,500 spending spree on iPads and mobile phones for her 'spoilt' teenage son has been spared jail. Maria Spruce, 40, was trusted with a local authority credit card but used it to buy the top-of-the-range products and a laptop computer. Town hall bosses at Wolverhampton City Council became suspicious while Spruce, an electoral registration assistant, was on a three-week holiday to Australia last November. They discovered that she had made 47 unauthorised purchases on the card, totalling \u00a33,517, over a six-month period last year. Spruce admitted once count of fraud by position but was spared jail when she appeared at Wolverhampton Crown Court on Friday. She was handed a six-month prison sentence, suspended for two years. Judge John Warner said: 'You had been trusted with the credit card but used it in a dishonest way. 'I accept that you were under pressure at home in relation to your son but many people have those sorts of pressures but get on with their life without resorting to dishonesty.' The court heard that Spruce, of Bilston, in the West Midlands, bought the items for her son who was 'very controlling and aggressive'. Prosecutor Joanne Barker said: 'A colleague covering the duties of the defendant opened a credit card statement and saw it had been used for purchases that were not legitimate office business. 'She told her employer that she had bought the items for her son who was very controlling and could be aggressive towards her.' Wendy Miller, defending, said: 'This was not a sophisticated fraud and was always going to be detected. 'She was trying to satisfy her only son who is difficult to control. The items bought for herself were few and far between.' Town hall bosses at Wolverhampton City Council (pictured) discovered that Spruce had made 47 unauthorised purchases on the card . Spruce admitted once count of fraud by position and was handed a six-month prison sentence, suspended for two years . The court was told that her son is now living with his father and Spruce will have to sell her house because she is unable to pay the mortgage after losing her job. A former neighbour of Spruce said: 'She bent over backwards for her son. He was very spoilt but she never gave him the discipline he needed. 'She probably felt guilty about being a single mum but she allowed herself to be completely manipulated by him.' Speaking after the sentencing, Wolverhampton councillor Paul Sweet said the sentence sent out a 'strong message'. 'The city council operates a zero tolerance policy on fraud and corruption and takes all allegations of fraudulent activity made to us extremely seriously,' he said. 'We will not hesitate to take action if we suspect fraud has been committed against the council - and, as a result, taxpayers - and we will make every effort to recover all monies stolen from the council.'",

        "document": "(CNN)It was nothing if not predictable. Take combustible issues like religion and sexuality, stir in a new law and talk of a boycott, then -- boom! -- the debate on social media explodes. And so it has proved with Indiana's new \"religious freedom\" law, signed Thursday by Gov. Mike Pence. The new law could allow businesses to turn away gay and lesbian customers if serving them would contravene the business owner's religious beliefs. Supporters of the bill say it protects their right to believe as they choose. Opponents say it is nothing but bigotry dressed up as liberty. The debate is nothing if not vitriolic. And colorful, too. \"Libs SHUTUP,\" reads one tweet, which goes on to assert that Indiana's \"Relgious Freedom Restauration Act (sic)\" is modeled on federal legislation signed by President Bill Clinton in 1993. People on the other side of the debate are equally emphatic -- and, it seems for the moment, more numerous. Some have likened the new law to permitting businesses to discriminate against black people, if perchance their religion dictated that. Others say that Indiana seems out of step with modern times. And then there is the business reaction -- both the nascent boycott from outside the state and the rush by some businesses inside the state to declare that, law or no law, they have no intention of turning anyone away. \"My team just canceled travel to IN due to the #ReligiousFreedomRestorationAct,\" tweeted a user under the name Mark C Somerville, who says he works for @salesforce. \"We stand against discrimination.\" And a tweet from a the St. Elmo Steak House, a business in Indianapolis, the state's capital and its largest city, pledged in capital letters to continue serving ALL. The word Freedom should only be used when it's inclusive and fair for all. Supporters of the law, however, made it clear what they thought opponents should do with their proposed boycott. \"Before you go and get too self-righteous w/ your #BoycottIndiana,\" a user called Caleb Parke tweeted, \"@GovPenceIN is protecting #religiousfreedom for EVERYONE! #EqualRights.\"",

The 25-year-old has been unveiled as one of the ambassadors of the Investec Derby Festival alongside a host of famous faces who were hand-picked to represent everything from food and racing, to fashion and music. Speaking about her latest coup, Millie said: 'Racing is one of those rare opportunities to combine glamorous outfits with statement hats. 'I paired a Hobbs dress and Philip Treacy hat during the shoot, which I loved. The Derby is the pinnacle of the summer season and I\u2019m looking forward to enjoying a spectacular day out.' Scroll down for video . Millie Mackintosh shows off her sophisticated style in a Hobbs dress as she's unveiled as one of the fashionable faces of the Investec Derby . Millie stars alongside champion jockey Frankie Dettori MBE, Olympic Gold Medallist and BBC athletics presenter Denise Lewis OBE, presenter and DJ Laura Whitmore and two-star Michelin chef Michel Roux Jnr. Speaking about the event, which takes place on June 5 and 6, Millie's good friend Laura Whitmore added: 'This will be my third year attending the Investec Derby and the fashion is just as much of a spectacle as the racing which is one of the reasons I love it. 'I really enjoyed the shoot, getting to experience it with such a great group of people was fun!'. The 25-year-old was hand-picked to represent everything from food and racing, to fashion and music .

Speaking about the event,  Millie's good friend Laura Whitmore added: 'This will be my third year attending the Investec Derby and the fashion is just as much of a spectacle as the racing which is one of the reasons I love it' Millie certainly knows a thing or two about how to dress for glamorous events. The star recently unveiled her spring/summer 15 drop full of bold floral patterns, hippy chic maxi dresses and the kind of festival fashion staples that she's made her signature. 'When it comes to summer dressing, you've just got to have fun with it. My clothes are really accessible and you can dress them up or down depending on the occasion,' she told FEMAIL. As well as style expertise, Millie, who trained as a make-up artist before finding fame, is a beauty buff with her own eyelash range. BBC athletics presenter champion Denise Lewis OBE, left, and DJ Laura Whitmore, right, also star in the stylish and summery shoot for the racing event . Sharing her top beauty tips for flawless summer skin, the star - a self-confessed sun worshiper - says SPF is essential. 'I loved sunbathing all my life and now I am so worried about sun damage so I always wear a tinted moisturiser with an SPF in and some cream bronzer and pastel eyeshadow for a natural sunkissed look.' Aside from fashion and beauty, fitness is one of Millie's passions and she's a walking advert for the healthy lifestyle she preaches. Whilst she's confident enough posting videos of her squatting, boxing and participating in the oh-so-fashionable but gruelling SBC class, there's one class Millie is afraid of trying. 'I really want to try this music video dance class at Frame studios but I am too embarrassed. I think it would be really fun and I probably need to learn to just let go of my inhibitions!'. As well as cramming in fashion design and fitness classes, Millie is preparing to release her debut book at the end of the month. If that wasn't enough, she's hoping to expand her eyelash range next year, is already working on her autumn/winter 15 collection and has some exciting health and fitness projects in the pipeline.

Brett Bingham, who teaches special education, has filed multiple complaints against the Multnomah Education Service District for allegedly harassing and discriminating against the educator because of his sexual orientation. Bingham found out he was being placed on leave during a field trip with his students on Friday. Oregon's 2014 Teacher of the Year Brett Bingham claims he has been placed on paid adminsitrative leave because he used his title as a platform to speak publicly about being gay . He said it was his lawyer, who received a letter from the district, who broke the news. 'I returned to school and nobody spoke to me,' he told Fox 12. 'At 3.30 I just packed up my favorite plants and put a box of my stuff together that I was afraid would be thrown away and I left.' According to a complaint Bingham filed with the Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries Civil Rights Division, problems with the district began shortly after he was named the state's  teacher of the year in October 2013. Bingham claims one such incident occurred after he was asked about his sexual orientation while giving a speech. The teacher said his department head left the event immediately and without saying anything to Bingham. He then claims she told him he could not speak about being gay or 'someone is going to shoot you in the head'. Bingham then alleged that the district placed him under a 'gag order' in April and told him he could not publicly speak or write unless his comments were approved. The teacher said he then filed a grievance with his union, which stated that he felt he was receiving 'disparate treatment' because of his sexual orientation. Bingham (pictured here with his partner on their wedding day)\u00a0claims one department head told him he could not speak about being gay or 'someone is going to shoot you in the head' Bingham claims the following retaliation was swift. He said he was told that he now had to receive district approval before he could attend any teacher of the year events and was denied from appearing at two Gay Straight Student Alliance events, as well as working with a local LGBTQ community center. Bingham said management also began ordering him to pick up coffee and take out their garbage, 'menial tasks' he claims he was not asked to perform 'prior to the greater public awareness of my sexual orientation'. Relations between Bingham and the district worsened when school officials said the teacher would lose his job if he attended a gala for the National Education Association's Foundation, who were presenting him with an award, in Washington, D.C., he claims. District Superintendent Barbara Jorgensen allegedly told Bingham he would not be granted leave to attend any events related to teacher of the year, claiming he had too many school absences. Bingham, who teaches special education, has filed multiple complaints against the Multnomah Education Service District for allegedly discriminating against the educator because of his sexual orientation . Relations between Bingham and the district worsened after the teacher was told he would lose his job if he attended the National Education Association gala, where he was to be presented with an award . In a tweet Bingham claimed district officials told him they would consider letting him 'attend the NEA awards' if he recalled his state and federal complaints. Bingham was eventually allowed to attend the event after the Oregon Education Association found a clause in his contract that protected his job, according to\u00a0OregonLive. Jorgensen was removed from the Superintendent position last week but the district claimed Bingham's complaints were not a factor, according to Fox 12. But Bingham believes nothing has changed and that there are other officials in the district who want to see him fired. 'There's no other explanation because I've never been in trouble,' he said. 'I have an excellent reputation.' MESD spokeswoman Laura Conroy declined to elaborate the district's reason for putting Bingham on paid administrative leave.",

His school visit comes as it was claimed negative comments about his diet are being deleted from his official Facebook page, meaning only positive and supportive feedback is published. Despite the Public Health Association of Australia expressing concerns that 'Bubba Yum Yum: The Paleo Way' cookbook could cause the death of infants, Evans visited a school in Ballarat, Victoria, where he taught children in years five and six how to cook paleo recipes. Scroll down for video . Celebrity chef Pete Evans was in the classroom on Thursday, teaching students about the benefits of his controversial 'Paleo Way' diet . 'We had the best time this morning with the grade 5 and 6 kids cooking thai chicken cakes with cucumber, avo, lettuce and corriander,' 'Paleo Pete' posted on his Facebook page. 'We also cooked mighty meaty muffins with loadsa vegies and some chia seed and coconut puddings. Nothing I love more than seeing kids learning new skills!' On Wednesday, it was announced that the release of Evan's paleo cookbook for children had been delayed due to grave concerns about the nutritional value of recipes in the book. The cookbook, Bubba Yum Yum: the Paleo Way, is the joint venture of celebrity chef and My Kitchen Rules judge Evans, a long time advocate for the paleo diet, baby-blogger Charlotte Carr and naturopath Helen Padarin. The Public Health Association of Australia said that one of the recipes- a do-it-yourself baby formula made from liver and bone broth- had the potential to stunt the growth of babies and impair development. 'In my view, there's a very real possibility that a baby may die if this book goes ahead,' said Professor Heather Yeatman, president of the PHAA. The criticism comes amid claims comments on Evans' Facebook page expressing negative sentiments over the paleo lifestyle are being deleted.

Daria, a health professional, posted on 'Blocked by Evans' after she had comments deleted and was blocked from his official Facebook page . After accusations from readers that their feedback was being erased, a rival Facebook page called Blocked By Evans was started, where people could raise their concerns freely. There was also a Twitter hashtag #blockedbypete. Just this week, in the wake of the cookbook controversy, comments questioning the safety of the broth were removed and the posters blocked from the page. Kirstie Cubbins, 31, a stay-at-home mother, had several comments she posted about the health concerns authorities has raised removed from the page. 'I linked to a News article about it [the bone and liver broth] and pointed out what the particular concerns about the formula was, and that it was by the public health authority,' Ms Cubbins told Daily Mail Australia. 'My comments were met with being told I was not welcome on the page as I was not going to support the paleo lifestyle.' Ms Cubbins comments were deleted and she was blocked from responding, though replies to her comments were left on the page. 'I haven't even commented on Pete Evans' page before but had been aware he is prone to deleting comments and blocking people,' she said. An ironic Twitter account mocked Evans visit to the school despite the controversy surrounding the book . 'My comments were never abusive, derogatory, rude or full of swearing. They just put the factual information across about why the baby formula recipe and other recipes in the new book were dangerous to babies.' Daria, a Paediatric Occupational Therapist, had a similar experience on the page when Evans posted to his Facebook page comments linking the modern Australian diet and the rise of autism. Evans, who is currently on a national tour promoting the paleo lifestyle, has long been a passionate advocate of the diet . 'I was disappointed to see yet another celebrity making an incorrect judgement about the developmental disorder. I commented to say that his statement was incorrect and that ASD [autism spectrum disorder] has multiple causes of which we are still discovering many,' Daria told Daily Mail Australia. Daria said she was surprised to see that Evans was advocating the elimination of entire food groups, including grains, and posted a further question regarding how the celebrity chef came to the conclusion 'despite good scientific evidence to show their nutritional benefit, particularly in wholegrain form.' Both of her comments were deleted and she is now blocked from commenting or liking any post on the page. 'I think banning and blocking people who are questioning, asking questions and discussing comments that are genuine and polite is dangerous because it creates an environment where one person controls what information is visible,' Daria said. 'Pete Evans has blocked many health professionals and professional bodies from his page. These are people who unlike him have extensive training, clinical experience and access to scientific evidence about health,' she said. 'I would think their skills would be respected by someone who wants to improve societies health. Its important to promote trust and dialogue between medical and health professionals and the public.' Publisher Pan Macmillan has reportedly held off on the scheduled release date of the cookbook of March 13 . Charlotte Carr (left), the wife of Australian Idol contestant Wes Carr (centre), runs the popular Bubba Yum Yum website and is a co-author of the book . Following claims in December last year that comments were being deleted from the page, three social media users launched a response page 'Blocked by Pete Evans' to address what they saw as a dangerous trend of blocking genuine discussion. Gabrielle, one of the moderators of the page, said that many people had been blocked from Pete Evan's official page, most of whom were enquiring for more information about the specifics of the diet. 'I and most of the individuals on this page where blocked for simply asking a question that challenged paleo ideology or posting a scientific journal paper link that disproved claims being made,' Gabrielle told Daily Mail Australia. 'We have been accused of being \"trolls\". However simply asking a question in a civil manner is not trolling. I have only ever commented on his page once and I was blocked,' she said. Gabrielle said that several health professionals even had their accounts 'pre-blocked'. 'A couple of dietitians who have their own blogs wrote open letters asking Pete to stop tarnishing our profession and for this they were pre blocked without even writing on his wall,' she said. 'It is very sad when someone who claims to know all the answers cannot even answer to health professionals.' Gabrielle said that she had even seen instances of 'tribe followers' asking for advice on ailments and being berated by users, or having their comments deleted. 'In the instance where a health professional has suggested they visit a doctor it is also deleted, which as you can imagine is a a great concern for the health of the individual reaching out.' Pete Evans, pictured with fellow paleo enthusiasts Luke Hines (left), and Wes Carr, wife of fellow co-author Charlotte Carr, has been an outspoken advocate of the paleo diet . Evans has previously released two best-selling cookbooks through publisher Pan MacMillan, including titles Family Food and Healthy Every Day . Evans, a My Kitchen Rules judge, is \u00a0a long time advocate for the paleo diet and has been outspoken . The publisher of the paleo baby cookbook,\u00a0Pan Macmillan Australia, released a statement which advised that 'the publication of Bubba Yum Yum: The Paleo Way has been delayed, and not recalled as incorrectly stated by Australian Women's Weekly on March 11, 2015. The publisher will be making no further comment at this time.' Evans has previously released two best-selling cookbooks through publisher Pan MacMillan, including titles Family Food and Healthy Every Day, and Carr, the wife of Australian Idol contestant Wes Carr, runs the popular Bubba Yum Yum website. Federal Health Minister Sussan Ley has allegedly been contacted regarding the issue, and publisher Pan Macmillan has reportedly held off on the scheduled release date of the cookbook of March 13. The Federal Department of Health released a statement regarding the concerns that had been brought to its attention. 'The Department of Health is aware of this publication and has concerns about the inadequate nutritional value of some of the recipes, in particular the infant formula, and has been consulting with experts and will continue to investigate this matter,' the statement said. A disclaimer at the back of the cookbook states that the co-authors 'in good faith' the recipes will lead to a healthier life, 'relying on the information contained in this publication may not give you the results you desire or may cause negative health consequences.' Despite this, the book has been described as 'a treasure trove of nutritional information and nourishing paleo recipes that are guaranteed to put you and your little one on the path to optimum health.'",

        "document": "Saudi Arabia is beheading criminals at an unprecedented rate - almost half of them for non-violent drugs crimes, the human rights charity Amnesty International has warned. The Arab state is believed to have executed 38 people so far this year, treble the number in the same period in 2014 and a sign its new King Salman is showing no mercy to offenders. Now Amnesty has sounded the latest of several warnings over the country's 'unfair' justice system and harsh punishments. Regime: Some 38 people have already been beheaded in Saudi Arabia this year. King Salman (above meeting British Prime Minister David Cameron) was crowned in January and shows no sign of leniency . The charity's Saudi Arabia researcher, Sevag Kechichian, told Adam Withnall of\u00a0The Independent: 'Almost half of this year's executions have actually been for non-violent drugs-related offences. 'There's no real rhyme or reason for this upsurge in executions, and in a way this makes it all the more alarming.' The Saudi authorities insist there is a surge in the number of executions because . Rape, murder, apostasy, armed robbery and drug trafficking are all punishable by death under Saudi Arabia's version of Islamic sharia law. No mercy: King Salman pictured in January . One diplomatic source told the AFP news agency the surge in beheadings had started long before the reign of King Salman, who was crowned in January after the death of his half-brother King Abdullah. 'The Saudi authorities want to show everyone they are strong, people can rely on them to keep the security and the safety in the kingdom,' said the source. The insider claimed the aim was to deter all forms of violence but the policy is linked to the kingdom's fight against the Islamic State group. In September, Saudi Arabia began air strikes against the terrorists in Syria as part of the US-led coalition, raising concerns about possible retaliation inside the kingdom. Security officers arrested three Saudis who allegedly acted 'in support of' the group when they shot and wounded a Dane in November. But Mr Kechichian said: 'The current rate has been truly unprecedented. It would... be a stretch to say that this is an attempt to deter violence.' The United Nations has said many Saudi trials are 'by all accounts grossly unfair' and that confessions are obtained under torture. Amnesty's annual report last week made a similar warning. 'Courts continued to impose death sentences for a range of crimes, including some that did not involve violence, such as \"sorcery\", adultery and drug offences, frequently after unfair trials,' it said. Trickle of news: Individual beheadings are only discovered when confirmed by the Interior Ministry (above) 'Some defendants, including foreign nationals facing murder charges, alleged that they had been tortured or otherwise coerced or misled into making false confessions in pre-trial detention.' Those executed have included five Pakistanis, an Indian, two Jordanians, two Syrians and a Yemeni, with few foreign governments willing to appeal publicly for clemency from the oil-rich state. Three beheadings in a single day on Tuesday - one for rape and two for murder - took the total so far this year to 38, according to an AFP tally.",

        "document": "(CNN)Milan has Moxy, while much of Europe is painted Blu. Jaz in the City is playing in Amsterdam come September. EVEN increases the odds of a good night's sleep, while Tune is in harmony with scaled-down budgets. And then there's the vibrant Vib and a new venue, Venu, soon arriving in Dubai. These statements begin to make sense once you realize that they're all the names of modern hotel brands. According to Chekitan S. Dev, a professor at the Cornell University School of Hotel Administration, hotels traditionally have been named after an owner or a place. But more recently, he says, \"the naming process has evolved from an off-the-cuff process into something far more systematic.\" So what's behind this influx of idiosyncratic hotel names, replete with misspellings and unexpected word usages? Look to millennials and psychographics -- the study of personality, attitudes, interests and lifestyles. Psychologists say the millennial psychographic is made up of independent-minded, adventurous individuals in search of new experiences. Hospitality brands are crafting their marketing strategies accordingly. \"Hotel companies are lazering in on consumer needs by using psychographic data in a big way,\" says Matthew Von Ertfelda, Marriott's vice president for insight, strategy and innovation. The explosion of social media also has a starring role in the name game. Brands of the 21st century need to have handles that resonate in the global, online world, say the pros. \"Thanks to social media, millennials are the first global generation,\" says Dr. Donna Quadri-Felitti, academic chair of New York University's School of Professional Studies Tisch Center for Hospitality and Tourism. \"And since this generation is so enamored with texting and tweeting, hotels really have to think how names will play in the new media world.\" For social media purposes, the number of characters in a name counts. Spelling is often sacrificed in the quest for brevity. But another reason for purposeful misspellings may be legal. Spelling is often set into an uncommon form to retain meaning while being trademarkable. \"The odder the name, the less likely someone has already captured it,\" says Cornell professor Dev. \"That's important in terms of intellectual property protection.\" It may explain why Venu and Vib are missing an \"e.\" Venu is a just-announced lifestyle brand, launching its first property in Dubai in 2017. According to parent company Jumeirah Hotels & Resorts, it's designed to give travelers \"the freedom to write their own story, their own narrative, to build their own scene.\" Best Western's new hotel entry, called Vib, is pronounced \"vibe.\" \"We tried to come up with names that celebrated individuality, while also connoting a vibrant spirit,\" says Dick Lew, a partner at Houston-based Acumen Design, a branding firm brought in to hone the name and the image. Hence Vib, which is derived from \"vibrant.\" Color also plays a big part in hotel branding. \"We incorporated a bright persimmon red in the design and the logo, in order to reflect the (Vib) brand's bold personality,\" says Lew. Moxy, the new Marriott partnership with IKEA, is going after \"a sassy, determined, individualistic consumer,\" according to Marriott's Von Ertfelda. The first Moxy opened at Milan's Malpensa Airport in September and more are coming in Europe this year. \"Naming Moxy was a four-month process involving a great deal of brainstorming,\" says Von Ertfelda. \"Once we came up with it, we knew we had a name with emotional resonance that hit a global sweet spot. \"At the same time, though, our lawyers noted the name had to be 'ownable and trademarkable.'\" The change of spelling from moxie to Moxy achieved that. According to Von Ertfelda, senior creative director Maria Rezende-Heiston selected hot pink for the Moxy logo to \"appeal to those who aren't afraid to express themselves\" while using a \"curved font to convey a sense of rhythm, fluidity and independence.\" Color is also key to hotel operator Carlson Rezidor, which is hueing (sic) toward Red and Blu. Blu came about in 2009, after airline SAS withdrew from a partnership with Radisson. After the split, Radisson SAS, a collection of European design hotels, needed a new name. \"We wanted to replace SAS with an equally short name,\" says Rose Anderson, vice president of branding for the Carlson Rezidor Hotel Group. \"We liked using blue from the old SAS logo, because it brought in the heritage of the former brand. \"At the same time, we were looking for a word with positive worldwide connotations ... and blue is the world's favorite color.\" So blue or bleu became Blu, a trademarkable spelling. Carlson Rezidor recently announced a new Red brand that will, according to Anderson, \"build on the Blu concept and further leverage Radisson's brand awareness.\" New brands are also being dubbed with what may seem to be random nouns. But there's nothing random about them. Last year, InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG) rolled out EVEN, a new brand cultivated for the growing wellness-minded audience, with two properties in the United States. EVEN expresses the desire for the balance travelers are seeking, says an IHG spokesperson. In its logo, specific colors were chosen to represent elements of nature. The four vertical bars of the logo are off-kilter, while the EVEN letters are composed on a flat horizontal line, representing the brand promise of helping guests stay in balance. Malaysia-based Tune Hotels provides \"five-star beds at a one-star price.\" The group has more than 40 properties worldwide, including five in London. Some in its management group were previously senior executives in the music business. It makes sense, then, that a travel company with a musical name would attempt to strike a global chord. Adding to the medley of avant garde brands, Germany's Steigenberger Hotel Group's Amsterdam hotel Jaz in the City will open in September, with others scheduled to follow. According to Steigenberger Hotel Group, coming Jaz in the City properties will be \"hip and happening hotels\" that \"move to the rhythm of today's curious global traveler\" who has a \"desire to embrace authentic experiences in a city hotel.\" You can't explore the hospitality industry's desire to appeal to the millennial mindset without nodding to W Hotels by Starwood. The brand now seems to have been ahead of its time with hotels that opened in pre-social media 1998. \"Starwood was the first hotel company to look directly at the customer as it evolved a new brand,\" says Paul James, global brand leader of W Hotels Worldwide, St. Regis and The Luxury Collection. W's target customer was a fashionable, high-energy individual -- someone who'd now likely be described as having a millennial psychographic. Starwood defined the brand by adding its \"Whatever, Whenever\" tagline to the simple W logo. Cornell's Dev says Starwood further imbued the brand with meaning by using words like witty, warm and welcoming in its advertising and marketing material. More than 15 years later, the W Hotel brand has more than 70 properties open or in development worldwide. Journalist Laura Powell started covering the travel industry for CNN in the 1980s.

        "document": "England's Ross Fisher faces a completely different challenge as he looks to successfully defend a European Tour title for the first time in his career in this week's Tshwane Open. Fisher ended a four-year victory drought with his win 12 months ago at The Els Club at Copperleaf, which, at 7,964 yards, was the longest course in European Tour history. This year the tournament, which is the sixth and final event co-sanctioned with the Sunshine Tour this season, has been switched to Pretoria Country Club, which measures 7,063 yards and has had the par-five fourth and 18th holes reduced to par fours, making it a par 70. Ross Fisher says it will be tough for him at the Tshwane Open this year but that he is looking forward to it . The Englishman plays a shot during a practice round at the Pretoria Country Club . Fisher poses with the trophy last year . 'It's a lot shorter and a lot more fiddly,' said Fisher of the course, which was redesigned in 2004 by Gary Player, who calls it a 'hidden gem'. 'There will be a lot of positional play off the tee, a lot of irons and not many drivers. 'It's an adaptation that we have to make as players. We don't generally play these types of golf courses. 'It's very different and I would prefer to be on a long golf course that's quite tight, because driving is my strength. 'It's going to be different this week. Your wedges will have to be sharp and you're going to have to get a hot putter, because I can imagine the scoring will be pretty good with some quality players here this week. 'I'm looking forward to the challenge and hopefully the game can live up to that.' Compatriot Andy Sullivan missed the cut in the Africa Open last week but is looking for his third win in South Africa in the space of 10 weeks, while home favourite George Coetzee has the benefit of local knowledge. Pretoria native Coetzee has been a member of the club since he took up the sport and won his first tournament here at the age of 10. 'I didn't build my game at this golf course,' Coetzee said. 'I putted well to shoot good scores here, but it's a drawer's golf course. There is a lot of risk and reward and on a lot of holes you can take it on. 'There are some advantages to knowing the course as well as I do, but it suits a certain type of golfer. Hopefully I make enough putts to make up for that. Andy Sullivan is looking for his third win in South Africa in the space of 10 weeks . 'I guess there's probably a little bit of extra pressure but hopefully I will thrive on it this week. 'I've got a couple of tricks that I know the course likes to throw at you and hopefully I'll use them to my advantage.' Compatriot Trevor Fisher Jnr comes into the event on the back of winning his first European Tour title at East London last week, a win which proved highly popular. 'It's been overwhelming,' Fisher Jnr said. 'All the messages and support, it's something special. I'm still busy soaking it in and looking forward to this week as well.'",

        "document": "Hidden in a vault in Marrakesh, it has been one of the most highly-anticipated albums in music history. And tonight, after six years, the Wu-Tang Clan finally opened the handcrafted silver box that holds their unheard record Once Upon A Time In Shaolin - before sealing it away once more. In an attempt to break free from the Spotify and YouTube era of freely-shared music, rap's most influential collective is selling the 31-track double LP to one bidder for millions of dollars. After a private online-only sale this month through art dealers Paddle8 - which employs Britain's Princess Eugenie - the buyer cannot share the album for at least 88 years. DailyMail.com was there with the group's de facto leader RZA, producer Cilvaringz, a small group of prospective buyers and half a dozen selected fans in Queens, New York City, for the first and last time any of the album would be played before the year 2103. Scroll down for video . Unprecendented: This is the Wu-Tang Clan's record Once Upon A Time In Shaolin that was played on Monday night to a small group before it is sold and kept secret until the year 2103. It has been six years in the making . The record comes in a silver, jeweled box with a specially-designed wax seal and a leather-bound book . The box: It was displayed for potential buyers who are expected to pay millions to obtain the sole incarnation . The Staten Island-born group revived the East Coast as an epicenter for hip hop in the early 1990s . Confirming the rumors that she would make a guest appearance, Cher's voice bellowed out during the 13-minute extract.\u00a0And though it wasn't played, DailyMail.com understands it to be true that Barcelona FC players also make a cameo appearance. Typical of the group's first record 36 Chambers, it features styles that shook the music scene in 1994 - soul samples, clips of dialogue from movies, and fierce rapping over sound effects of rain and thunder. Reiterating its own grandeur, there are regular skits and pieces of dialogue that say, 'this has never been done before.' All of the Staten Island clan's eight living members appear on it - but had no idea what they were recording when they laid down their parts. The record casing was handcrafted from silver and wood by artists in Morocco, with a seal designed and printed by wax-smiths in Serbia. 'This has never been done before,' RZA told DailyMail.com after playing the record. 'Music is just handed out now, the industry is in crisis. People feel like they deserve to have it for free. This is art. You can take a picture of the Mona Lisa but that's not art. 'The same with this: you can never reproduce it - this is the final thing.' The pre-sale event played up to the idea. Those invited were subjected to airport-style security checks, and electronic devices were confiscated. In a dark room, buyers spoke to auctioneers as light symphony music played. The nickel silver and jeweled case with black cow leather lining was sat on a podium under spotlight, with two bodyguards standing either side. While some  were fans, others were advisers who hailed from as far as Asia to inspect the 'artwork'. One adviser for a Chinese collector, who wished to remain anonymous, told DailyMail.com collectors are clamouring to get their hands on the record and its silver box - whether they like Wu-Tang or not. The box comes inside a cedar wood treasure chest covered with black cow leather and light beige velvet lining. Inside, is a cinematic-style record, plus a leather-bound 174-page manuscript printed on gilded Fedrigoni Marina parchment with lyrics, credits, tales about the recording. The adviser said: 'Someone said it would be worth $1 million. That's nothing. This is something completely different; completely new. I don't think I could put a price on it. 'The concept has not been seen before - and from the biggest rap collective in history... It is huge.' The Wu-Tang Clan formed in the early 1990s, reviving the East Coast's reputation as an epicenter for hip hop. RZA - pronounced 'rizza' - drew together nine MCs, including his own cousins who adopted the pseudonyms Ol' Dirty Bastard and GZA. The remaining slots were filled by Raekwon, Masta Killa, U-God, Ghostface Killah, Method Man, and Inspectah Deck. Ambition: RZA, n\u00e9\u00a0Robert Fitzgerald Diggs, wants the long-awaited album to be treated like a work of art . Unlike their other albums, it has not been produced by the group's de facto leader RZA (pictured) but by his apprentice, Moroccan rapper and producer Tarik 'Cilvaringz' Azzougar . The new album pays homage to the Wu-Tang Clan's history and meteoric rise to dominate the record industry . With industry domination in their sights, RZA saw that each member of the Clan was signed with different production companies, while maintaining their loyalty as a group. Their first album, 36 Chambers, was hailed as unprecedented, with samples from soul music and kung fu movies. Spanning 128 minutes, the stories and rhymes were largely recorded in Staten Island, New York, and hark back to their original mid-90s lyrics about the Shaolin. It features all eight of the original members plus some affiliate rappers. And as for Cher's cameo appearance, RZA said: 'Did nobody ever have a crush on Cher? She's the ultimate. Ain't nobody like Cher.' Unlike their other albums, it has not been produced by the group's de facto leader RZA but by his apprentice, Moroccan rapper and producer Tarik 'Cilvaringz' Azzougarh - a Wu-Tang fan who visited the group's New York office five times until they took him on. Cilvaringz explains he and RZA were already developing the concept of a record charting the Wu's history when the music industry changed completely. Once Upon A Time In Shaolin has been stored in a handmade silver and nickel box embossed with the Wu's Shaolin symbol and a decorative design by Yahya, a British-Moroccan artist . Collectively, the group has produced seven albums - sometimes within months of each other . Within five years singles plummeted to the price of $0.99, and artists were streaming their work for free. Simultaneously, Cilvaringz was chairing an art festival in Morocco, where he saw three tent poles bought for thousands of dollars. 'That [was] the first time I asked myself: \"Why and how are these artists valued at such a price?\" People like Dre or Kanye or RZA are geniuses in what they do, and their music is valued at 99 cents. 'No disrespect to Andy Warhol, Basquiat, Damien Hirst, or any other artists, but if you walk down the streets and ask people randomly, \"Do you know Damien Hirst? Do you know Basquiat?\" they'll say \"Who?\" If you say, \"Do you know Dr. Dre? Do you know Kanye?,\" they'll say \"Yeah.\"' The album, he says, pays homage to the Wu-Tang Clan's history and meteoric rise to dominate the record industry. The group became known for their business genius as they created a collective but each had their own solo contracts, thereby dominating the recording industry . 36 Chambers: This was the collective's debut album which revolutionized the hip hop scene . And despite years of disputes erupting between the clan's members, RZA insists that there was 'no tension' when he informed his brethren he had been working on a secret album, adding 'the eight members, excluding myself, are the most talented MCs I have ever encountered. They are true artists because they aren't taught. You can't teach art.' Speaking later with Genius executive editor Sasha Frere-Jones, RZA described his ambitions: 'Maybe Richard Branson will just buy it and put it on one of his planes and send it to another planet. That'd be dope!' However, Cilvaringz conceded, the fact that the buyer cannot commercialize it means that they could distribute it for free. 'I hope they don't,' RZA said. 'This is unique and something only has value if it is rare.'",

        "document": "(CNN)With the ongoing protests over the shooting death by police of black teenager Tony Robinson in Madison, Wisconsin, the racist chanting of fraternity members at the University of Oklahoma, and now the inexcusable shootings of two police officers in Ferguson, Missouri, it's safe to say that the always-strained race relations in this country are being pushed to the breaking point. And the point with the most stress is the delicate relationship between police forces and the minority communities that they serve. To approach things from a more positive angle, the situation is dire enough that we absolutely have to try to uncover the good and not dwell on the negative. The best time to make things better is when it seems that everything is getting worse. This unacceptable status quo can motivate us to take the necessary steps to address the problems, which are not going to disappear unless we honestly deal with them. When things are going wrong, responsible people can begin by saying the right things. President Obama said on Twitter, \"Violence against police is unacceptable. Our prayers are with the officers in MO. Path to justice is one all of us must travel together.\" The Congressional Black Caucus issued a statement saying, \"The CBC understands the frustrations in Ferguson, but a response of violence is not the answer during this transformative moment in our country.\" And Attorney General Eric Holder noted, \"This was not someone trying to bring healing to Ferguson. ... This was a damn punk, a punk who was trying to sow discord.\" For the most part, authorities in Missouri have been careful not to blame the peaceful protesters. Surely, not all responses have been as measured, but the gravity of the situation will hopefully bring out the best in people. While we pause for a moment to let passions cool, we can use the time to consider how best to move forward with common resolve instead of mutual recrimination. The way forward is to engage citizens in the community -- to bring them into the room when decisions are being made about policing policies and procedures to make sure that those policies and procedures address the community's real concerns. And it's about putting law enforcement officers in the community as welcome members of that community -- as guarantors of the safety and security of the people instead of intimidating outside forces. This approach would benefit both the community and the police. I'm certain that officers would rather be appreciated and valued by the people they serve than be pressured to fill city coffers by issuing unnecessary citations, as noted in the DOJ report on Ferguson. Nobody becomes a cop because they secretly long to be a collection agent. One of the easiest ways to integrate law enforcement officers into the community is to physically put them on the sidewalks by increasing the number of cops who work good old-fashioned foot beats. Officers who view the world through a patrol car window are separated from the people they serve by more than a sheet of glass. Being encased in a vehicle alienates a person from the world around them. The cop on the beat is not just a quaint notion from old movies, he can be a bridge between police forces and the people they serve. Another idea is to give cops bicycles, which has brought so many law enforcement officials in touch with other cyclists in the community. Lack of community policing is one of the shortcomings cited in the DOJ report on Ferguson. In areas where the gulf between law enforcement and the neighborhood is too wide, mediators can be used to initially bring the two sides together. After all, both sides ultimately have the same goal of safe and peaceful neighborhoods. Both police departments and members of the community can take proactive steps to come together on more than a purely professional level.  A tech services company in the South Bronx recently hosted a video game competition with police officers and residents of the neighborhood. The event left local teenagers saying things about the cops like \"basically they're like us.\" Ultimately, police should be considered members of the community -- a notion that needs to be encouraged by police departments and neighborhoods alike. Communities can make the local cops part of their neighborhood celebrations. New Orleans Police Det. Winston Harbin became a minor Internet celebrity for his impromptu dancing with local people during Mardi Gras. Besides just being fun, Harbin's interaction with the community helped foster the type of mutual appreciation and respect that are essential to effective community policing. Fear and mistrust among minority communities toward police are the legacy of many decades of racism, unequal treatment, bias, subjective stereotyping and lack of opportunity. It is times like now, when that anger and resentment are boiling, that we address it. With the right approach, we can begin to change the attitude between the black community and the police from \"HandsUpDon'tShoot\" to \"HandsTogetherInTrust.\"",

But researchers are working on algorithms to give computers this skill too. Now, scientists at Facebook have come up with questions that they say artificially intelligent machines must answer, if they can ever match human brainpower \u2013 but some of them are a bit tricky, meaning some people may fail them too. Scientists at Facebook (logo shown) have come up with questions that they say artificially intelligent machines must answer if they can ever match human brainpower \u2013 but some of them are a bit tricky, meaning some people may fail them too . The team from the social media firm\u2019s AI lab in New York have come up with a list of 20 questions to separate humans from robots, because they say \u2018many existing learning systems can currently not solve them.\u2019 They test different types of reasoning and the ability to process language. 1) The first question of the 20 listed in the research paper was the simplest for a computer to answer. It is: . John is in the playground . Bob is in the office . Where is John? 2) A harder example for a computer to answer is a question that requires it to differentiate three separate arguments, such as: . Mary gave the cake to Fred. Fred gave the cake to Bill. Jeff was given the milk by Fred. Who gave the cake to Fred? Who did Fred give the cake to? What did Jeff receive? Who gave the milk? 3) Another task tested a machine's ability to perform simple counting operations by asking about the number of objects. For example: . Daniel picked up the football. Daniel dropped the football. Daniel got the milk. Daniel took the apple. How many objects is Daniel holding? 4)\u00a0Basic deduction skills were tested by questions such as: . Sheep are afraid of wolves. Cats are afraid of dogs. Mice are afraid of cats. Gertrude is a sheep. What is Gertrude afraid of? 5) And reasoning about size was tested by this question: . The football fits in the suitcase. The suitcase fits in the cupboard. The box of chocolates is smaller than the football. Will the box of chocolates sit in the suitcase? The intelligent computers were tested on 20 questions in total, but none of them got a perfect score. The answers to the five examples listed, are shown above . The sometimes tricky questions test different types of reasoning and the ability to process language. A stock image of a perplexed person is shown . Some of the questions require machines to recall facts, while others need reasoning, or to count the number of objects, expressed in a written passage. The researchers say that humans should be able to score full marks. While you may have got one answer wrong, none of the seven computer learning programmes that Facebook tested got all 20 questions right. The experiment was designed to test whether a machine can answer questions \u2018via chaining facts, simple induction, deduction and many more,\u2019 the study published on arXiv says. Scientists are keen to create this ability so that humans can talk fluently with machines, which could lead to robots looking after the elderly and more intelligent websites, for example. The paper says: \u2018One long-term goal of machine learning research is to produce methods that are applicable to reasoning and natural language, in particular building an intelligent dialogue agent.\u2019 The experts aim to \u2018classify these tasks into skill sets, so that researchers can identify (and then rectify) the failings of their systems.\u2019 The results of the test show that humans are still ahead of the game when it comes to interpreting the world\u2019s subtleties and language. The questions are written in very clear and simple terms so there is still a way to go before computers catch us up.",

        "document": "David Gill, the Football Association vice- chairman, says FA Cup replays and the two-legged League Cup semi-finals may have to be sacrificed in the season of the 2022 World Cup. Why wait? If anything, replays are detracting from the excitement of the competition, and the format of what is currently the Capital One Cup is an anomaly. It should not take FIFA\u2019s monstrous destruction of football\u2019s calendar to make the English game see sense. By chance, there were no replays in the FA Cup fifth round this year and they were not missed. The great Cup shocks of this campaign have all happened on the day, inside 90 minutes. David Gill suggested removing cup replays, and he has a point, even if it it has taken Qatar to make it happen . Cambridge United were excellent to earn a replay against Manchester United, but lost the second game . That is when Bradford City beat Chelsea and Sunderland, when Middlesbrough eliminated Manchester City, when Blackburn Rovers beat Swansea City then Stoke City. A few lower division tussles aside, all the games that went to replays went with form. Manchester United defeated Cambridge United, Sunderland won at Fulham, Liverpool came from behind to beat Bolton Wanderers and Southampton won against Ipswich Town. Replays favour the bigger teams anyway. If Cambridge could have taken Manchester United to extra-time, and maybe to penalties, on a crummy pitch at a boisterous Abbey Stadium, who knows what might have happened? Heading to a decider at Old Trafford, their moment had passed. Jonathan Stead's goal against Chelsea was part of a shock that re-affirmed the FA Cup's giant killing tradition . Bradford celebrate their win at Stamford Bridge, and didn't need a replay to upset the Premier League leaders . We cling to tradition, but tradition had teams playing replay after replay until they could be separated. Those encounters had an epic feel. In 1979, Arsenal and Sheffield Wednesday needed five matches \u2014 including three that went to extra-time \u2014 lasting nine hours before they could be torn apart. The second replay ended 2-2, the third 3-3. Arsenal won the fourth 2-0. That is the true gladiatorial tradition of the FA Cup, but it is unthinkable with modern fixture congestion. So as the shoot-out that completes the first replay is in itself a compromise, why is it needed at all? Middlesbrough also caused an upset, by beating Manchester City, but replays rarely lead to shocks . Smaller clubs might be better rewarded if games were decided on the night by a penalty shoot-out . A game decided on the day, one hit, with extra-time and penalties, would go some way to restoring tension and drama. When the FA has to alter its company accounts because the FA Cup sponsorship deal confidently included by former general secretary Alex Horne has not materialised, it is ridiculous to pretend the current format is a winner. The same with the League Cup. It is decided over one game in every round, then two in the semi-finals, and back to one for the final. What is the point of that? Better to have consistency and let the calendar breathe a little. It should not need FIFA\u2019s selfishness to be a catalyst for reform in the English game. The time to change is now.",

        "document": "William Tallon was more than just the Queen Mother\u2019s favourite servant. He rose from impoverished beginnings to become her confidant and close friend. As the first part of a remarkable new biography revealed last week, Tallon was also a predatory homosexual who breached Royal security by bringing young men back to Clarence House at night. And he made powerful enemies. Here, in the final extract of Backstairs Billy, we reveal that courtiers took their revenge by banishing him from the Queen Mother\u2019s side, shamefully disregarding her wish that he should be allowed to live at Clarence House for the rest of his life. And whatever became of his meticulous diary, the \u2018black book\u2019 of life with the Royals? So close: Billy with the Queen Mother on her 88th birthday in 1988 (right). He cuts a lonely figure in 2003 (left), a year after her death . Within days of Billy Tallon\u2019s death in November 2007, a small group of men were seen entering his flat in Kennington, South London. All Billy\u2019s possessions were boxed up and put in storage. There is no proof that things went missing, but the speed with which events occurred shocked his friends, one of whom said: \u2018It was all very odd. Would you expect your former employer to visit your house and go through your things? We don\u2019t know for sure, but that\u2019s what we think happened \u2013 the Royal household had sent a team to go through Billy\u2019s possessions before they were sold...\u2019 Billy Tallon would tell anyone who listened that the Queen Mother had promised him that his little gatehouse cottage at Clarence House would be his home for life. \u2018I thought she had left instructions to that effect but I could hardly ask her to put it in writing to me,\u2019 he said. \u2018I suppose I was rather naive in thinking that a letter would survive if it meant everyone had to put up with me for a few more years. In some ways they were quite ruthless, you know.\u2019 Rumours: Billy said he knew Princess Diana was having affairs while still married to Prince Charles . Some months after the Queen Mother\u2019s death in March 2002, Billy received a short letter telling him that Gate Lodge had to be vacated. The deadline gave him little time, but he obediently packed his things and left. There was no leaving party, no letter of thanks, no formal goodbye. An official made sure he was out on time. Billy didn\u2019t find his new life easy. His 51 years of service had given him no time to learn how to live in the evenings and at weekends. For years he had organised lunches and dinners for the Queen Mother, but he had never had to make his own meals. Now his life of privilege was over: he shambled along to the shops like any other elderly single man. He began to eat irregularly and sometimes not at all. He was also shocked at the cost of a good bottle of wine. Billy had developed a taste for the finer things in life and he was suddenly cut off from them all. But there were compensations. Billy was an amusing man with a remarkable history and he was invited to an endless series of parties, which gave him a faint glow of the life he had once enjoyed with the Queen Mother. \u2018I go to these things because I find it so difficult to be on my own,\u2019 he confessed. \u2018I enjoy the parties, but would happily give them up if I could go back to my old life.\u2019 Billy spent night after night in his local pub, The Dog House, where he would get drunk and invite all and sundry back to the flat \u2013 anything was better than being alone. A friend recalled: \u2018Billy sometimes went into terrible glooms that were alleviated only by alcohol. It was a habit he had got into at Clarence House. Alcohol restored some of his charm, his confidence and his wit. But the fact he was no longer drinking the finest wines in the finest company \u2013 as he saw it \u2013 took a lot of getting used to and he never really managed it.\u2019 Despite being regaled as the grand old man of Royal service, his friends say that Billy became a humbler figure in exile. Power had corrupted him and he knew it. He had been beastly, he once said, to some of those who worked for him and I think he felt rather bad about it. \u2018I was naive, I suppose,\u2019 he said. \u2018The household disliked me because I was too close to the Queen Mother. I remember one of the advisers saying, \u201cWho on earth do you think you are?\u201d I replied, \u201cI\u2019m a shopkeeper\u2019s son from Coventry but I\u2019m afraid my company is preferable to yours.\u201d I enjoyed my little victory, but I can\u2019t imagine he ever forgave me.\u2019 In his most bitter moments, he recalled how, in the Queen Mother\u2019s last months, when she was too confused to know what was going on around her, he became so frustrated by repeated refusals to let him see her that he became hysterical. He was told that if he did not calm down, the police would be called. Close friends: The loyal servant dancing with the Queen Mother at Balmoral as Prince Charles watches . Royal advice: The Queen Mother (pictured with Queen Elizabeth, left, and Princess Margaret, right) had told Billy to 'never trust anyone' \u2018I was upset and they didn\u2019t care,\u2019 he said. \u2018As far as the household was concerned, I was simply an ex-employee as if I\u2019d worked in the Palace for six months washing bottles. It hurt, but the truth is some members of the Royal household enjoyed my unhappiness. It was time for their revenge. They knew the Queen Mother could no longer protect me so the knives were out. I suppose I was silly not to have known it would happen.\u2019 Perhaps Billy, more than anyone, should have heeded the advice given to him by the Queen Mother, who told him at the beginning of their relationship: \u2018Whatever you do, William, never trust anyone. Ever.\u2019 Billy often told me he wanted to save his best stories for publication. The Royals, he explained, are very careful about what they say and do. But Billy knew their secrets. He knew, for example, or at least said he knew, that Princess Diana was having affairs while still married to Prince Charles and long before it was generally known that the marriage was in trouble. He also knew a great deal about the younger generation of Royals. Ironically, given his own lifestyle, he was scathing about the younger ones drinking and tumbling out of clubs at 2am. A close friend of Billy\u2019s said: \u2018He was definitely writing something, which is perhaps why so many odd things happened after he died. \u2018I\u2019m sure that in the same way that someone probably destroyed the Queen Mother\u2019s instructions that Billy should be allowed to stay on at Gate Lodge, they also destroyed whatever it was he had written about his life at Clarence House.\u2019 When, some months after his funeral, Billy\u2019s possessions came up for auction at a provincial sale room in Colchester, Essex, they represented just a small part of his possessions. I know that because I visited the flat regularly. Another oddity is that not a scrap of written material survived the visit by the unidentified team of young men seen visiting his apartment, including the memoir he was thought to be writing \u2013 and especially his \u2018black book\u2019, as his diary was known. Billy Tallon would tell anyone who listened that the Queen Mother had promised him \u00a0his little gatehouse cottage at Clarence House (pictured) would be his home for life . His solicitor, who was also his executor, clearly felt a few letters and mementos were unlikely to fetch a fortune. In the event, however, it took more than ten hours to dispose of more than 700 lots that raised a total close to \u00a3500,000. The highlight was a short, handwritten letter from the Queen Mother to Billy asking him to prepare for an outdoor lunch on a trip to Scotland. It finishes: \u2018I think that I will take two small bottles of Dubonnet and gin with me this morning, in case it is needed.\u2019 The letter went to an anonymous bidder for a \u00a316,000. But the assumption that these memoirs might have been especially revealing, vindictive or damaging to the Royal Family are probably wrong. Billy felt uniquely privileged to have worked for so long in a job that he loved.

The lawsuit says Derek Landon Wood of Alabama died in June 2014 shortly after eating a chocolate chip cookie purchased at a Publix Super Market in Clarksville. The boy, who was visiting family in Tennessee, was allergic to tree nuts. Derek Landon Wood of Alabama died in June 2014 shortly after eating a chocolate chip cookie purchased at a Publix Super Market in Clarksville and now his family are suing the food chain . The lawsuit, which was filed on March 20, says the store bakery did not post warnings about ingredients or possible cross-contamination, and the mother bought the cookie only after a worker assured her it was safe. Derek's family filed the lawsuit on Friday in federal court in Nashville and are seeking unspecified amount of damages. They claim the grocery store should be declared liable under the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act 'to raise awareness of potential fatal food allergies in American children.' The family also claims Publix was negligent for not labeling its baked goods and identifying any allergens, for not posting signs warning of potential allergens or cross-contamination and for not properly training employees to respond to questions about food allergens. A Publix spokeswoman declined to comment on the litigation but said in an email that the company posts allergen information at its bakeries. 'We were very sorry about the loss if this young man. Our prayers go out for him and his family,' a Publix Super Markets spokesperson told USA Today. The incident happened on June 3 last year when Landon, his mother, aunt, and a cousin visited the Publix Super Market in Clarksville, above . The incident happened on June 3 last year when Landon, his mother, aunt, and a cousin visited the Publix store. Landon's mom bought an unlabeled 'Chocolate Chew' cookie that he wanted. The mother specifically asked a Publix employee at the bakery counter whether the cookie contained any tree nuts. 'The Publix associate affirmatively said the Chocolate Chew contained no tree nut ingredients,' the lawsuit states. Landon ate the cookie back at his aunt's house and then went into anaphylactic shock. He died despite being immediately being given medication by his mother and efforts by emergency medical personnel and doctors at a local hospital.",

The Blues manager has been outspoken in his views regarding Chelsea's treatment by officials, even claiming there is a 'campaign' against the Stamford Bridge club.

Jose Mourinho has backed the club website's claim that they receive an 'abnormally low' number of penalties . Jose Mourinho leans around Nemanja Matic to watch Eden Hazard in training on Friday afternoon .

Mourinho is admant he was not behind the article - but insisted he has not had any second thoughts about his stance against referees this season. 'Did I know about the article? No, I\u2019m just the first team manager,' said the Portuguese, whose side face Hull on Sunday. 'I never regret when I speak from my feelings, I never carry it, the consequences.

Amy Stinnett received a letter from  the Bobby Ray Memorial Elementary School, in McMinnville, Tennessee, the day after her son Adam visited the barbers. It said his haircut was distracting and would have to be shaved off. When Ms Stinnett refused to comply the principal told her that Adam would not be able to return to school, Fox News\u00a0reported. An email to Ms Stinnett said: 'I have the utmost respect for the military and its members. 'However we are not a military school and the boy's haircut is against our rules.' Adam's stepbrother  served in Afghanistan and is still an active soldier. He inspired Adam to join the military and is the reason he got the haircut, Ms Stinnett said. The letter was even more surprising as the school is named after a Navy Corpsman  killed in the Vietnam War. David Robert 'Bobby' Ray was awarded a Medal of Honor posthumously after using his body to shield a Marine from a grenade in 1969. Ms Stinnett said she wants an apology and described the situation as 'crazy' and 'bizarre'. She said: 'They shamed my son and they shamed a lot of military people - that's how I feel about it.' The Warren County School District said it could not comment on the incident or the investigation as it was an internal school matter. It added: 'Neither Bobby Ray Memorial Elementary, nor any school in Warren County School District, prohibits military haircuts.' Ms Stinnett (right) said she wants an apology from the school and described the situation as 'crazy' and 'bizarre' The letter was even more surprising as the school (above) is named after a Navy Corpsman who was killed in the Vietnam War . Navy Hospital Corpsman David Robert 'Bobby' Ray was killed in action during the Vietnam War. He was born on February 14, 1945 in McMinnville, Tennessee. At the age of 21 he enlisted and spent three years serving in the Navy before he was killed. A Medal of Honor was posthumously awarded for his actions during the Vietnam War. Officers said he used his body to shield a Marine from a grenade on March 19, 1969. The award was given to his family on April 20, 1970. He also received the Purple Heart Medal, the Combat Action Ribbon, the National Defense Service Medal, the Vietnam Service Medal with star and the Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal. The Warren County School District said: 'We are extremely proud that Bobby Ray Memorial Elementary was named in honor of a true American hero.'",

        "document": "Christopher Dearlove coughed over nurses telling them he had Ebola to try to get a hospital bed . Britain's most prolific 'hospital hopper' has been jailed after shutting down an A&E department  by pretending to have Ebola. Homeless Christopher Dearlove, 59, was banned from entering any NHS building unless he had a genuine medical problem in 2010 after making up ailments to get a free bed for the night. But earlier this year he forced Diana Princess of Wales Hospital in Grimsby into lock-down after telling nurses he had Ebola, coughing over them and demanding treatment. He was jailed at Grimsby Crown Court for 14 months. Dearlove, who is an alcoholic, had been drinking for almost four hours when he walked into the Grimsby A&E in February. The man, who is thought to be homeless, told nurses he had recently returned from West Africa where his wife had died of the disease. He claimed he had tested positive for Ebola at Johannesburg airport before coughing over staff. Using a false name, he was then heard saying: 'It\u2019s not my fault if everyone becomes infected.' Part of the A&E was forced into lock-down as nurses rushed into protective clothing. He was arrested after a member of staff recognised him and phoned the police. It is not thought Dearlove received any testing or treatment at the hospital. Sentencing, Judge\u00a0David Tremberg said: 'You gave hard pressed medical services more cause for concern and work. 'They should not be diverted from genuinely sick and injured patients and not be indulging in your fantasies. 'Claiming Ebola and coughing on people is a particularly unpleasant and unattractive act.' Part of Diana, Princess of Wales Hospital in Grimsby was forced to close as a result of the stunt in February . In carrying out the stunt Dearlove broke an anti-social behaviour order issued in 2010 which banned him from visiting hospitals unless genuinely ill. It was imposed after he told nurses at various facilities that he was a haemophiliac with AIDS and coughed up fake blood to get a room. On separate occasions he claimed to have been experiencing weight loss, night sweats and pain in his chest in order to be admitted. From 2006 the NHS began distributing images of the fraudster to stop A&E departments across the country from admitting him. The alcoholic would give a false name and medical history and list symptoms he knew were likely to secure him an isolated room. Each of his stints cost between \u00a3400 and \u00a31,000 according to the NHS security management service. Every time he was admitted. Defending at Grimsby Crown Court, Ernie Lidster said he had a psychiatric disorder. Dearlove was jailed for 14 months at Grimsby Crown Court (above). In court his lawyer said he had a mental disorder .",

Ms Kia Walker has flown from her home near Chicago to stay in the hospital where 19-year-old Miss Mack has given birth to the daughter, whom she has named Stella Schaefer, after her boyfriend Tommy Schaefer. Ms Walker, Mr Schaefer\u2019s mother, is understood to be concerned that the baby girl will remain with Miss Mack in Kerobokan Prison when a court verdict is delivered in the next few weeks. Scroll down for video . New mother: Accused murderer Heather Mack, 19, pictured in her hospital room at\u00a0Sanglah Hospital in Denpasar, Indonesia on Wednesday after giving birth to a baby girl. The father is co-accused, Tommy Schaefer . Baby's future: Schaefer's mother Kia Walker was pictured at the hospital on Wednesday, smoking and talking to Mack, and is allegedly pressuring the teen to let her take care of the newborn . Miss Mack and Schaefer have been accused of the premeditated murder of Miss Mack\u2019s socialite mother, Sheila von Wiese-Mack and if they are found guilty they will face many years behind bars - or even the death penalty by firing squad. What happened? Heather Mack and her murdered mother, Sheila von Weise Mack, pictured in an undated vacation photo. Mack is allowed to keep her newborn baby in prison for the first two years . In a desperate attempt to come to an arrangement for her granddaughter\u2019s immediate future, it is understood Ms Walker has been talking in detail to Miss Mack about her intended plans to keep the baby with her in Kerobokan prison for the full two years that babies are allowed to remain there with their mothers. \u2018The discussions have been pretty intense,\u2019 said a hospital source. \u2018There has been a lot of pressure on Heather to think again about keeping a baby in a prison cell for the first years of her life.\u2019 It has not been revealed whether Ms Walker has offered to look after her grandchild - or whether the same offer has been made from Miss Mack\u2019s relatives. 'There is no doubt she is concerned about the welfare of the baby,' said the source. While Miss Mack recovers from the caesarian delivery in Bali\u2019s Sanglah Hospital on Wednesday, Mr Schaefer\u2019s mother has been seen through a hospital window talking to her at length. Ms Walker has also been observed standing on a hospital balcony, smoking cigarettes.

She said she had been advised not to comment publicly on the murder case in which her son has been accused of battering Mrs Wiese-Mack to death and stuffing her body in a suitcase, with the help of his girlfriend Heather.

        "document": "Things got very steamy this morning at the Today show studios when host Hoda Kotb and TV personality Regis Philbin took part in new charity dare The Twizzler Challenge live on air, and shared a passionate - if very one-sided - kiss. Hoda, 50, looked as though she got rather more than she bargained for when Regis, 83, energetically took the lead on the act; requiring them to each take opposite ends of one Twizzler, place them in their mouths and nibble the licorice until their lips met in the middle. When Hoda's quick peck on Regis' lips at the end of the challenge did not seem to satisfy her former NBC co-host, he grabbed her head with both hands and delivered her a passionate smooch, as Hoda froze up in surprise. Scroll down for video . Good cause: Much like the now-infamous ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, the Twizzler test has taken off, and benefits Manhattan-based charity New York Collaborates for Autism . Magic moment: The stunt required Hoda and Regis to each take opposite ends of one Twizzler, place them in their mouths and nibble the licorice until their lips met in the middle . Hoda and Regis were officially dared to take on the Twizzler Challenge last week by Today hosts Matt Lauer and Kathie Lee, who themselves shared a series of rather awkward, perfunctory kisses during their on-screen moment. Once the concept, which aims to raise awareness for autism, was explained to Regis during his guest segment on the show this morning, he enthusiastically asked: 'Are we going to kiss?' 'I'm not sure,' responded Hoda, before timidly spritzing his open mouth with breath spray. 'Let me look at your lips,' Regis exclaimed, leaning in. 'She could swallow me! I've never seen lips like that. Honest to God, something's going to happen.' And indeed it did. Hoda nibbled at the licorice straw until she reached Regis' lips, before issuing him a conservative peck. Too much? Today host Hoda Kotb, 50, (right) got more than she bargained for as part of this morning's Twizzler Challenge, when former co-host Regis Philbin, 83, (left) smothered her with an enthusiastic smacker . Not finished: Hoda gave Regis a quick peck, before jerking her head away from him . Regis then launched in for a full-on smooch, as Hoda darted her head away, only for Regis to grab her back and give her a lingering mouth-to-mouth smacker. 'Boy you look like you went in there!' squealed Kathie Lee, as Hoda recovered in stunned silence. 'It was pretty good,' attested Regis, lipstick smeared over his face. 'You got a boyfriend?' Much like the now-infamous ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, those who fail to complete the Twizzler test after being nominated have to donate to Manhattan-based charity New York Collaborates for Autism. Last week at the NBC studios,  Matt Lauer and Kathie Lee were nominated by fellow Today correspondent Meredith Vieira. Meredith explained that she first took the challenge with Today co-anchor Willie Geist the previous week on her talk show and later donated $5,000 to support autism programs nationwide. Get away! Hoda tried to push Regis away as he lunged in to take the kiss even further . Recovery: Hoda was visibly shaken after the amorous display, which took place live on air . 'This is clearly a transparent attempt by Meredith once gain to make out with her colleague,' Willie joked on the morning show. Meredith immediately made it clear that she intended to challenge Matt, but remained coy about who his partner would be. 'Is there anybody around that we can ask?' Willie said. Savannah Guthrie, who was sitting next to Matt, quickly left her chair. 'I am willing to get up out of this seat,' she said as she made room for Matt's partner. When Kathie Lee walked on stage, Matt enthusiastically told her: 'Get over here.' Panic: Ironically, it was Regis who was most concerned about the challenge before it began, telling Hoda that he was worried she would 'swallow him' because of the size of her lips . Kathie Lee joked to Matt: 'Your world is going to be on fire.' 'This is nothing compared to what goes on in the make-up room,' she added. As Kathie Lee and Matt sat face to face, they both noted that their awkward encounter was all in aid of a good cause. 'And then we get to challenge somebody,' Matt explained. Kathie Lee stared at Matt with her eyes wide open before she started to furiously eat the Twizzler that was in her mouth, quickly moving towards her partner. 'Really aggressive,' Willie commented from the sidelines. Follow the leader: Hoda and Regis were officially challenged to take on The Twizzler Challenge by Today hosts Matt Lauer and Kathie Lee, who themselves took part last week (pictured) Matt pulled away as Kathie Lee's lips brushed his, only to move back into to give her another kiss. 'I love you anyway,' he said. 'I would have done that for nothing.' Someone else joked: 'Who the Lady and whose the Tramp?' After their epic kiss, Kathie Lee nominated her former co-host Regis Philbin and her current co-star Hoda Kotb for the Twizzler Challenge. After their epic kiss, Kathie nominated Regis and Hoda for the Twizzler Challenge. But Matt had a different pairing in mind, noting that the cast of Mad Men would be on the show on Monday. Fun moment: Hoda's fellow Today show hosts Willie Geist and Meredith Vieira took the Twizzler Challenge on her talk show . New nominees: Daily Mail Online Editor-at-Large Piers Morgan and Nina Parker also took the challenge on Access Hollywood Live . 'I'm available,' Savannah said as soon as the good looking cast was mentioned. Matt ultimately chose actors Jon Hamm and John Slattery to take on the challenge. 'If John Slattery needs an understudy for that Twizzler Challenge with Jon Hamm, I am available,' Savannah reminded Matt again. The Twizzler Challenge started earlier this month at Comedy Central's Night of Too Many Stars benefit for autism, which was hosted by Jon Stewart. When someone on Twitter dared Willie and Orange is the New Black star Uzo Aduba to have a Lady and the Tramp moment with licorice in exchange for a donation, the Twizzler Challenge was born. Access Hollywood co-hosts Billy Bush and Kit Hoover also took up the same candy-based encounter on their show last Friday before nominating Daily Mail Online Editor-at-Large Piers Morgan and his fellow guest Nina Parker to do the same. 'I got to say that was really enjoyable,' Piers said after they completed the challenge.",

        "document": "Bats are often associated with vampires, caves and other dark, creepy or dingy imagery. But this adorable little fruit bat wolfing down a banana is bound to change your perception. Filmed by Denise, a lady who rescues and cares for fruit bats, the video shows a much sweeter side of what is usually considered a rather spooky animal. Hungry fellow: The tiny fruit bat calms down completely when it spies a banana . The bat appears to pull hilarious facial expressions as it tucks into the fruit snack . Munching on the banana, the wide-eyed bat looks extremely excited as it fills its mouth before lifting its head back in satisfaction. Going in for another bite with even more enthusiasm, the bat opens its mouth as wide as it can and stuffs its face once more. Looking at the camera while it finishes its mouthful, the bat takes one last big bite of the banana and uses its pointed tongue to help shovel down the food. Before lifting its head one last time as if completely full and entirely satisfied. According to Storyful, an abundance of rainfall in Brisbane, Australia in recent weeks has resulted in food supplies becoming scarce - as a result, this bat was rescued by a lady called Nanette. At one point the bat is even seen poking its tongue out as it makes sure it has eaten every last morsel . Denise is among the people rescuing the bats from fruit netting during the poor weather. Referencing the video, Denise said the fruit bat was initially a little feisty until it spied the banana. After that he was happy once and began stuffing his face with the food \u2013 as is seen in the video. There's no need to be scared of these bats judging by the adorable rescue animal at Denise's shelter . Denise told MailOnline: 'Rain is good news for the coming winter but it's not such good news for hungry bat bellies. 'Although there is a magnificent array of native flowering occurring, rain washes the nectar and pollen out of the blossom and flying-foxes are forced to seek sustenance elsewhere. 'As a result we get an increased number of calls for bats trapped in large aperture fruit tree netting during and after rain events.' Denise added: 'Please net, grow and harvest sustainably. Never use any netting you can poke your finger through and use shadecloth or a similar weave to protect your fruit. Even better still, take what you need and share the rest with our wildlife.'",

        "document": "He may be pushing 94, but Prince Philip\u2019s not lost one iota of his sense of humour. Watching his wife sign an empty picture mount \u2013 in which a glossy portrait of the monarch was later placed - the on-form royal remarked waspishly: \u2018It\u2019s not a very good likeness, is it?\u2019 Philip had accompanied the Queen to Southampton to officially name the new \u00a3473 million P&O cruise liner Britannia, in which the finished photograph will, eventually, hang. Scroll down for video . Cheeky: He may be pushing 94, but Prince Philip proved he hasn't lost one iota of his sense of humour today as The Queen launched the Britannia ocean liner in Southampton . And it wasn\u2019t the only cracker uttered by Philip during the course of their visit. On being introduced to P&O\u2019s Human Resource director, Paula Porter, yesterday, he remarked: \u2018Humans are not resources!\u2019 Fortunately the executive took the off-the-cuff comment in her stride, laughing afterwards: \u2018I thought it was a very good line. I shall be using it again.\u2019 The Queen, 88, also appeared to be thoroughly enjoying herself, even tapping her feet in time to the music of the Band of the Royal Marines as they played a merry jig before Britannia\u2019s official naming ceremony. Wit: Watching his wife sign an empty picture mount \u2013 in which a glossy portrait of the monarch was later placed - the on-form royal remarked waspishly: \u2018It\u2019s not a very good likeness, is it?\u2019 Tears of laughter: The Queen chuckled during the ceremony and wiped away a tear of laughter . Nowadays the monarch doesn\u2019t actually have to swing the bottle of bubbly \u2013 in this case a Nebuchadnezzar (20 bottles) of English sparkling wine from the Wiston Estate Winery near Pulborough, Sussex \u2013 used to christen the boat herself. Instead she discreetly presses a button and the work is done for her. The new mechanised system isn\u2019t entirely foolproof, however. When the bottle struck the side of the ship it exploded with an almighty bang, sending one hefty shard of glass speeding to within a few feet of where the Queen was sitting. Fortunately the forward-thinking people from P&O had erected a plastic screen to protect the elderly sovereign. All the same, it was quite a moment and clearly struck a chord with the guest of honour. When the Queen met a line-up of chefs later, including Marco Pierre White, she referred to the incident exclaiming: \u2018It exploded!\u2019 Olly Smith, Britannia\u2019s wine expert, replied: \u2018It did, didn\u2019t it, Ma\u2019am? Spectacularly' Round of applause: The Queen cheers during the naming ceremony for Britannia . Having a chat: The Queen enjoys a chat during the naming ceremony for Britannia . Round of applause: The Queen claps as the sixth cruise ship she has sponsored is officially named . Enjoying the sunshine: A dapper Duke of Edinburgh appeared to be enjoying his day in Southampton . Is that you dear? The Duke of Edinburgh flips through the programme and stops at a picture of the Queen . Thankfully, however, some traditions haven\u2019t gone by the wayside. \u2018God bless her and all who sail in her,\u2019 the sovereign also said. Surprisingly, Buckingham Palace confirmed yesterday, the Queen has only named four civilian ships previously (the QE2 in 1967, Oriana in 1995, Queen Mary 2 in 2004 and Queen Elizabeth in 2010, with the Britannia as the fifth). But the monarch appeared to be thoroughly enjoying herself, chatting nineteen to the dozen with other VIP guests as she toured the vessel. She was heard telling TV chef James Martin, one of a number of celebrity chefs who will be offering classes for passengers: \u2018The first time I ever saw white bread was on board the old Queen Elizabeth. It was rather fascinating.\u2019 The ship, which cost its owners \u00a3473m to build, is the third P&O Cruises ship to be named Britannia but is easily the largest of the trio, with 15 passenger decks, 13 restaurants and four pools on-board. Britannia was also the name of the Queen's much-loved Royal Yacht which was decommissioned in 1997 under the orders of then Prime Minister Tony Blair. Berthed in Edinburgh's Port of Leith, the ship is now a static tourist attraction but sailed more than 1,000,000 miles during its 40 years in royal service. The new Britannia is expected to rack up a similar number of miles during its own career, although unlike the Queen's yacht, it will host tourists rather than dignitaries. Today, however, dignitaries were the order of the day for the new Britannia, with the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh shown around the new ship by a large group of them. Isn't it magnificent? The Duke of Edinburgh and the Queen appear to be sharing their observations of the ship . Ready to launch: The Queen presses the button that will launch a bottle of fizz against the ship . Smashing! The Queen smashes a bottle of \u00a324.95 English sparkling wine against the ship . Job done! The bottle of English sparkling wine smashes into hundreds of pieces . Celebration: Red white and blue confetti rains down on the Queen after the bottle is smashed . Sponsor: The Queen is all smiles as she becomes godmother to P&O Cruises' ship Britannia . Magnificent: Britannia is the newest P&O Cruises ship and can carry up to 3,600 people . Gargantuan: The vessel also boasts 15 passenger decks, 13 restaurants and four swimming pools . The Queen is no stranger to cruise ships in any case, having become godmother to no fewer than five - now six, including Britannia. First of the liners launched by the Queen was Cunard's QE2, which was christened in 1967 and made her maiden voyage in 1969. Now permanently moored in Dubai after retiring in 2008, its owners plan to turn it into a floating luxury hotel, although plans for the conversion are currently stalled. Other vessels launched by the Queen include the Oriana in 1995, the Queen Mary 2 in 2004 and Queen Elizabeth, another Cunard ship, in 2010. Well-wishers: The Queen was joined by Darcy Bussell, Anneka Rice and hairdresser Nicky Clarke . Supporter: Chef Marco Pierre White at the event. The P&O vessel features menus created by the famous chef . Enjoying the day: \u00a0Chef James Martin from Sunday Brunch with a friend at the event . Showing her support: Olympic Champion Sally Gunnell OBE made a rare public appearance at the reception . Royal salute: Comedian Rob Brydon salutes the captain while making a speech at the event . Hope his skills weren't needed! Retired swimming champion Mark Foster attended the event with a friend . Colourful: Entertainment was laid on for the guests, including professional dancers . Perfectly aligned: A marching band was also on hand to provide music . Spectacular scene: Hundreds of VIP guests were invited to watch the ceremony . Although the Queen is godmother to the largest number of vessels, she is not the only member of the royal family to have launched a cruise ship. In 2007, the Duchess of Cornwall launched Cunard's Queen Victoria at Southampton, returning five years later to blow out the candles on its fifth birthday in 2013. The same year saw the Duchess of Cambridge become a ship's godmother for the first time, with the royal, who was making her last public appearance before the birth of Prince George, invited to christen Princess Cruises' Royal Princess. The vast Royal Princess is one of the largest cruise ships ever built and has space for 3,600 guests, as well as an over-water 'Seawalk' which allows travellers to see what's going on below. Other vessels with royal connections include the Navy's new aircraft carrier, HMS Queen Elizabeth II, which was launched by Her Majesty in Rosyth with a bottle of whisky last year. The Duchess of Cornwall also has a naval vessel to her name, in her case the high-tech nuclear-powered submarine, HMS Astute. She is also the patron of a Cornish river ferry named the Duchess of Cornwall, which launched in 2008 and plies the waters between Falmouth and St Mawes. Launch: The Duchess of Cambridge has also played godmother to a ship, launching her first in June 2013 . Smashing! Her ship was Princess Cruises' gargantuan Royal Princess, which can carry up to 3,600 people . Royal approval: The Duchess of Cornwall sponsored Cunard's Queen Victoria, launching it in December 2007 .",

        "document": "Police believe they have found the bodies of a pregnant celebrity chef and her husband three days after a man was charged with their murder. Cristie Schoen Codd, 38, a season eight finalist on the Food Network Star, and Joseph Codd, 45, were killed in their Leicester, North Carolina, home last Thursday, police have said. The remains were discovered in Buncombe County on Thursday, but officials say they have not been positively identified. Robert Jason Owens, 36, a construction worker who they had hired to work on their home, was booked\u00a0on two counts of first-degree murder, the murder of an unborn child, larceny and breaking and entering on Tuesday. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Believed dead: Police believe they have found the bodies of celebrity chef Cristie Schoen Codd (left), 38, a season 8 finalist on Food Network Star, and her husband Joseph Codd (right), 45 . Linked: Robert Jason Owens, 36, who has been charged with murdering a pregnant Food Network star and her husband, was a key suspect in the disappearance of Zebb Quinn (pictured) 15 years ago, it has emerged . Suspect: Sheriff Van Duncan said Owens (pictured) was a 'primary suspect' in the 2000 disappearance of 18-year-old Quinn, who vanished while he was going to look at a car for sale in Asheville with Owens, then 21 . Dr. Sharon Sweede told Ashville's Citizen Times: 'I\u00a0did a brief exam of these remains. We don't have positive identifications. We really can't make any other comment . It has emerged that Owens was a 'primary suspect' in the 2000 disappearance of Zebb Quinn, 18, who vanished while he was going to look at a car for sale in Asheville with Owens, then 21. Quinn, who has not been seen since the night of January 2 that year, was captured on surveillance video buying sodas with Owens at a convenience store after he got off work at Walmart at 9pm. The pair then drove away separately. But they were apparently heading to the same destination to look at a Mitsubishi Eclipse for sale that Quinn was interested in buying, police told\u00a0Fox Carolina. Owens later told police that a short while later, Quinn flashed his headlights at him and the two pulled over. Quinn then went off to return a page, before returning in a 'frantic' state, Owens said. Cancelling the pair's plans to see the Mitsubishi, Quinn reportedly told Owens he needed to leave and drove off, bumping into his friend's truck on his way. Since that moment, he has been missing. On January 3, Quinn's mother, Denise Vlahakis, filed a missing person's report.\u00a0Two weeks later, the alleged victim's car, a 1990 Mazda Prot\u00e9g\u00e9, appeared in the parking lot of a nearby restaurant. Bizarrely, a live puppy was inside the vehicle, which was situated at The Little Pigs Barbecue near a hospital where Vlahakis worked. A pair of lips were also drawn on the car's back windshield. Unanswered questions: Quinn (left), who has not been seen since the night of January 2, 2000, was captured on video buying sodas with Owens (right, in his mug shot in the Codds' murder case) at a convenience store after he got off work at Walmart at 9pm. Later that night, the teenager drove off and has not been seen since . Work: Quinn, a Roberson High School graduate, had no extra clothes, money or contact lenses solution with him on the night he vanished. He also enjoyed his work at this Walmart (pictured), his family said at the time . Mother: On January 3, Quinn's mother, Denise Vlahakis (pictured), filed a missing person's report. Two weeks later, the alleged victim's car, a 1990 Mazda Prot\u00e9g\u00e9, appeared in the parking lot of a nearby restaurant. Bizarrely, a live puppy was inside the vehicle, while a pair of lips were drawn on the car's back windshield . It remains unknown who the Labrador-mix puppy - which was around three months old - belonged to. It was later adopted by a police officer, according to\u00a0The Charley Project\u00a0cold cases website. In February, police were\u00a0authorized\u00a0to take hair, blood and saliva samples from Owens in relation to the\u00a0disappearance of Quinn, whom his family said would not have gone away of his own accord. Although they never acquired evidence to warrant charges against Owens,\u00a0Sheriff Van Duncan told The Citizen-Times in Asheville Owens 'was definitely a primary suspect in the Zebb Quinn case'. Vlahakis later said of her son: 'We all feel very certain that he was killed that night', explaining how he had no extra clothes, money or contact lenses solution with him on the night he vanished. Speaking to Fox Carolina, the grief-stricken mother added: 'It is hard because we don't know and it's hard because we can't say goodbye and kind of put everything at rest.' Movie set: Mrs Codd (pictured in a Food Network photo) ) was due to cater on a movie set, while her husband was heading off to Los Angeles to work as a key grip on a production when they vanished. It was a very big movie set for Mrs Codd - she had just announced her firm would be providing food on the set of The Big Short . Home: In the Codds' supposed murder case, the couple had hired Owens, who owns a construction company, to do some work at their home (pictured). They were both set to leave for work on Sunday - but never made it . Scene: Authorities (pictured at the scene) believe the Codds were murdered on Thursday by Owens - three days before he reportedly returned to their home and stole a 'laptop computer, jewelry and a Glock handgun' In 2012, Quinn's disappearance was featured on the Investigation Discovery Channel show, \u00a0'Disappeared', which covered various theories relating to the baffling cold case. One theory revolved around a woman whom Quinn was apparently romantically interested in. The woman, Misty, reportedly had an abusive boyfriend who had made threats toward the teenager. However, Misty and her partner were questioned by police at the time and no arrests were made. Authorities have said said they believe more than one person may have been involved in Quinn\u2019s disappearance and presumed murder. In the Codds' supposed murder case, the couple had hired Owens, who owns a construction company, to do some work at their home. They were both set to leave for work on Sunday. Mrs Codd was catering on a movie set, while her husband was heading off to Los Angeles to work as a key grip on a production. It was a very big movie set for Mrs Codd, as she had just announced her company, Tree Hugger Catering, would be providing food on the set of The Big Short. The adaptation will star Hollywood actors Brad Pitt, Ryan Gosling, Christian Bale and Steve Carell. However, authorities believe the Codds were murdered on Thursday by Owens - three days before he reportedly returned to their home and stole a 'laptop computer, jewelry and a Glock handgun'. Family members reported the couple missing on Sunday, according to reports. Police have not disclosed whether they have suspicions on how the couple might have been killed. Big names: The adaptation will star Hollywood actors Brad Pitt, Ryan Gosling, Christian Bale and Steve Carell . Mrs Codd, who grew up in Mississippi,was five months' pregnant with their first child at the time. The Codds' cars and two dogs were found at their home. James Fisher, a member of a local band that played the Codds' wedding last September, said the pair were a 'beautiful couple'. Speaking of Mr Codd, the musician told the\u00a0Citizen-Times of Mr Codd: 'I know he believed in giving people second chances, and he'd hired people out there who'd been in prison.' It remains unclear what Owens' motive was behind the alleged murder. Buncombe County District Attorney Todd Williams said he has not yet decided if he will ask for the death penalty in the case. Owens, who is being held without bail, appeared in court on Tuesday, where he requested an attorney, ABC News 13 reported. His next hearing is scheduled for April 7.",

        "document": "A Florida man has captured astonishing video that shows an intelligent manatee drinking from a garden hose like a straw. The hose was hanging over the edge of a dock in Miami Beach when the 'sea cow' approached and 'grabbed' onto it with its flippers. It then shoves the end of the hose into its mouth to get its refreshing fill of fresh water, which it requires to survive. Even though manatees are found in salt water, they do not consume it. The large 'sea cow' swims over to the long blue hose in order to get its much-needed fresh water intake . Filmed from the end of the dock, the manatee can be seen in the water below holding onto a long blue hose with its flippers. It takes a drink from it as the video maker, Lawrence Schiffman, tells the people with him: \u2018I like how he uses his arm to put it into his mouth.\u2019 The video shows the marine mammal dropping the hose and swimming after it. Debating whether the manatee is a he or she, and deciding to go with the latter, Mr Schiffman continues to give a play-by-play of the animal\u2019s actions. The video concludes with the obviously thirsty marine mammal still clutching onto the hose, guzzling water running from an unidentified source. The manatee can be seen using its flipper to grab the hose before it puts it into its mouth like a straw . Manatees are very large, fully aquatic and mostly herbivorous marine mammals. Studies suggest that they must have some access to fresh water for proper regulation of the salt within their bodies. This means that on average they must return to fresh water every one to two weeks to get their fill. Manatees ingest water through actively drinking as well as eating aquatic plants, and are able to move freely between marine environments.",

The Saracens winger, who was on the books of Manchester City as a teenager, had to give up his ambition of becoming a professional footballer because he was \u2018too small\u2019 to make the grade. Ironically, the dream of playing at Wembley transpired through rugby, but an afternoon with Mertesacker, Olivier Giroud and Wojciech Szczesny provided a taste of what might have been. David Strettle (far left) poses with Saracens team-mates during a visit to meet Arsenal players . \u2018They all dwarfed us, but gone are the days where you have people like Julian Dicks and Vinnie Jones running around in midfield,\u2019 said Strettle at a sponsors\u2019 cross-code challenge day. \u2018I was always a better footballer at school \u2014 Andrei Kanchelskis was my idol \u2014 but I wasn\u2019t big enough to make it with City. That\u2019s when rugby took over at about 16. \u2018It\u2019s funny how both games have changed. Now you\u2019ve got your Iniestas and your Messis: small guys who are so skilful.\u2019 Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud signs a doll for Strettle during a visit to London Colney on Friday . David Strettle scores a try to help Saracens to LV= Cup glory over Exeter Chiefs last weekend . Strettle draws comparisons between the northern and southern hemisphere games, highlighting the superior skillset of forwards in New Zealand and Australia. Their lighter emphasis on the breakdown, he says, forces the big men to stand out in the backline and become more clinical in attack. The record-breaking final weekend of the RBS 6 Nations bucked the trend and, having seen England beat France in a 90-point thriller, Strettle feels more needs to be done to spice up the competition. \u2018You need to bring in the bonus point to discourage that conservativeness,\u2019 he said.

Yet it is approaching two years since he played the last of his 14 Tests and he has learned not to wait by the phone on the day of Stuart Lancaster\u2019s squad announcements. Jack Nowell and Anthony Watson ended the Six Nations as England\u2019s first-choice widemen, but Strettle, 31, has been surprised at the amount of chopping and changing \u2014 with Jonny May and Semesa Rokoduguni both drifting in and out. David Strettle last played for England in the Test against \u00a0Argentina on June 8, 2013 . \u2018There\u2019s a situation where someone gets dropped after one bad game,\u2019 said Strettle. \u2018Then another player comes in and then it\u2019s back to the start again. \u2018It\u2019s the coach\u2019s prerogative but this close to the World Cup I can\u2019t get my head around the fact someone is starting one week and not in the squad a couple of weeks later. \u2018I\u2019ve learned not to hold my breath about getting picked.

Not safe: The match between\u00a0Kansas City Royals and Los Angeles Angels was delayed when a swarm of bees traveled across the pitch and landed on the net (top right) Bee swarms are common in Arizona in March and it's not the first time the Angels have had to deal with the flying nuisances. In 2013 they have two regular season games delayed and disrupted by a swarm in Anaheim. Manager Mike Scioscia admitted he had never seen the honey makers create the kind of buzz they did on Sunday. Sciosa said: 'We've never had them migrating, but like a tornado, they landed on the microphone. Fortunately, they stayed there until we could get rid of them.' Pitch invasion: The honey bees flew across the pitch and settled on the microphone and back netting in the match in Tempe, Arizona . But Royals boss Ned Yost was left a little saddened by the whole thing. He said: 'I've never seen mass bee genocide like that. 'All you have to do is get some smoke. Trust me, I live in the country. 'You take some smoke out there because the queen is in there somewhere, you get a Shop-Vac and suck them all in and take them out to the parking lot and let them go. 'They're just honey bees, man.

        "document": "(CNN)Police in Mesa, Arizona, know some things about Ryan Elliot Giroux, accused in a string of shootings that left one man dead and five people wounded. He's 41, has an extensive criminal record and served time in prison, according to online inmates records. He's on probation. Giroux used to have tattoos indicating white supremacist beliefs on his face but apparently had them removed, according to photos. One thing investigators don't know: What caused Giroux to allegedly go on a deadly rampage. On Thursday morning, Giroux made his first court appearance. He faces multiple charges, including murder, armed robbery with a deadly weapon, kidnapping, aggravated assault and burglary. The prosecutor requested $2 million bond and the judge imposed it. Grioux has been sent to prison twice for felonies, including an attempt to commit aggravated assault. He was sentenced to seven years and six months behind bars in July 2007, but was released in October 2013, according to online inmate records. His probation runs through October 2016. He also had a run-in with authorities in Santa Monica, California. He allegedly committed assault with a knife in the early morning hours of March 26, 2006, and was detained by witnesses, said Santa Monica Police spokesman Sgt. Rudy Camarena. Giroux was arrested on accusations of attempted murder and parole violation, but police records weren't immediately clear on how the case was resolved, Camarena said Thursday. Police are looking for a motive in the first shooting on Wednesday, but say the other violence happened as the suspect tried to rob people and get away from authorities. The first shots were fired after the suspect got into an argument at the Tri-City Inn with three people that he likely knew, according to Det. Esteban Flores of the Mesa police. One man shot at the Tri-City Inn died, Flores said. Police identified him as David James Williams, 29, reported CNN affiliate KNXV. The motel is across the street from the East Valley Institute of Technology. According to a police press release, the suspect next shot a man during a carjacking at a nearby restaurant and drove away in a stolen Honda Accord. Grioux tried to carjack another vehicle but failed, police said, and crossed the street to break into an apartment, where he shot and tried to rob a fifth person. He went to another apartment complex and shot a sixth person, police said, before fleeing to a condominium complex. Flores said Mesa's SWAT team found Grioux in a vacant second-floor condo. Police used a Taser stun gun to subdue him. Police said one man is in critical condition at a hospital, KNXV reported. The other victims, including the mother of the slain man, were treated and released from hospitals, KNXV reported. Authorities on Thursday released a photo of a bruised Giroux in which he had a tattoo on his neck but no tattoos on his face. An Arizona Department of Correction's photo released earlier showed a heavily tattooed Giroux, with the words \"Skin\" and \"head\" tattooed over his eyebrows. The number 88 was on his left temple, with additional ink on his chin and neck. \"Those are typical tattoos that you do see sometimes on white supremacists, but we don't know if that has anything to do with what happened today,\" Flores said. Neo-Nazis use the number 88 as an abbreviation for \"Heil Hitler.\"  H is the eighth letter in the alphabet, so the Nazi salute becomes 88 in shorthand. Flores said he believes all of the shooting victims were white, with one being white and of Hispanic descent. \"I have no information that his (Giroux's) affiliations or beliefs had anything to do with what occurred today,\" Flores said. News of the shootings caught the attention of the state's senior U.S. senator. \"My thoughts and prayers are with the victims and families impacted by the tragedy in Mesa today,\" U.S. Sen. John McCain said in a statement released Wednesday.  \"Our deepest thanks are with the Valley police and first responders who assisted the victims and tracked down the perpetrator to bring this dangerous situation to an end.\" Mesa is about 20 miles east of Phoenix and is Arizona's third-largest city. CNN's Stephanie Elam, Amanda Watts, Steve Almasy, Jason Hanna, Tina Burnside, Tony Marco, Stella Chan and Michael Martinez contributed to this report.",

The brunette reality star-turned-supermodel has been spotted at Chanel, Balmain, H&M and every glitzy fashion party thrown. And always wearing a pair of towering heels. The 19-year-old catwalk star has picked up a few tricks to surviving all night (and day) in uncomfortably high heels on her travels around the world's red carpets, and now she's sharing them with us. Scroll down for video . Whether she's at a red carpet event or stalking the runway Kendall Jenner is a seasoned expert at donning a high heel, seen here at Paris Fashion Week, and now she's sharing her secrets with us . Balmain AW15 . Click to shop the current collection at Net-a-Porter! Visit site . So it seems Kendall Jenner gets Kim Kardashian's hand me downs... This cute velvet look on Kendall was first seen on Kim yesterday as she attended the Balmain AW15 show, even before it had been strutted down the catwalk by a model. But clearly Kendall took one look and decided she was going to rock it herself to the after party. And while the half-sisters have very different body shapes they both looked gorgeous in this vampish ensemble. It looks like a dress but is a top and skirt and we love the ruffles and slightly Gothic vibe. And of course if you want to add an element of luxury to your look then velvet is a surefire way to do it. This mini looks great with bare legs and high heel sandals but worked just as well with opaque black tights on Kim. But we do have to say we love the addition of the belt by Ms Jenner. It really accentuates her tiny waist. Asos, Boohoo and Missguided have all got velvet dresses that will give you Kendall's look for less. So then the only question is, who wore it best? Asos velvet dress (now reduced to $44) Visit site . Missguided velvet dress . Visit site . Asos velvet midi dress . Visit site . Boohoo velvet mesh sleeve dress . Visit site . Speaking to Elle.com, Kendall revealed that her top trick is to distribute the pressure of the heels by alternating her weight on each foot. 'I switch off from one foot to another a lot, like this. [She crosses one foot behind the other in her now-signature pose.]' Kendall went on to explain: 'You have to keep moving your feet!' Although this seems rather counter-intuitive, the point is to never keep the pressure on the ball of one foot for too long, but rather to regularly shift the weight to alleviate the pain. The model sported lower heels for the recent Chanel Autumn/Winter 2015 show, but her top tip works for all heel heights . After the show comes the after-party! Kendall still sporting sky-high heels after the Balmain show with BFF Gigi Hadid . In the interview, Kendall also went on to reveal a physical attribute that makes heel-wearing even more painful. 'I have the longest toes in the world; they're spider toes. They are. I have spider fingers, too! So they're kind of being crunched right now...' The solution? Wearing expensive heels, the model insists that it's down to quality. 'Shoes [that] are good. They're Manolo Blahniks. And they're high.' Kendall told Elle.com that the trick to wearing heels is to distribute the pressure of the heels by alternating her weight on each foot .",

        "document": "A mother-of-three whose sex life was ruined after a negligent delay in spinal surgery has won \u00a32.4million in damages from the NHS. Heather Tait was in tears yesterday when the award was announced at London\u2019s High Court. The 34-year-old photographer had told an earlier hearing in Birmingham that her \u2018passionate\u2019 sex life with her husband Russel had been ruined by the complications she continues to suffer from. Heather Tait (left) was suffering from acute back pain when medics sent her home without carrying out an MRI scan . Judge Martin McKenna, who made the award, said Mrs Tait had told doctors that she \u2018now feels that to a degree there is no point in having intercourse\u2019. She also felt her closeness with her husband had been \u2018jeopardised\u2019 by her lack of enjoyment in sex. Mrs Tait, of Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, said as she left court: \u2018I\u2019m pleased that it is finally over.\u2019 She was the boss of her own company and winning respect as a professional photographer before she went into Cheltenham General Hospital in July 2009, suffering from severe back pain. Judge McKenna \u2013 who only had to decide the amount of damages after a judgment was entered for Mrs Tait against the Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Trust in 2012 \u2013 said although it was suspected she had a prolapsed disc, she was sent home without an MRI scan. By the next day, Mrs Tait\u2019s condition had deteriorated. She returned to hospital and a scan revealed a massive prolapsed disc. She had emergency spinal surgery at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham on July 8, 2009. The 34-year-old developed a devastating back condition after delays in emergency scans and treatment while being treated at Cheltenham General Hospital . The hospital's negligence left Mrs Tait 'doubly incontinent, with a loss of sexual sensation and some psychiatric damage,' London's High Court (pictured) heard . Judge McKenna said the trust had admitted if she had had the scan and surgery earlier, she would not have developed the severe injuries she now suffers from. Mrs Tait has been left doubly incontinent and \u2018has suffered a loss of sexual sensation and some psychiatric damage\u2019, the judge said. Cauda equina syndrome is a serious condition where the nerves at the very bottom of the spinal cord become compressed. Symptoms include: . Doctors advise seeking medical assistance immediately if a person develops these symptoms. They should visit their GP or the accident and emergency (A&E) department of the nearest hospital. If cauda equina syndrome is not promptly treated, the nerves to the bladder and bowel can become permanently damaged. Source: NHS Choices . She continues to suffer from back pain. As well as helping her husband to run a conferencing organising business \u2013 Crystal Clear Productions (CCP) \u2013 Mrs Tait ran her own photography business, Heather Tait Photography. Judge McKenna said she was not a person who would exaggerate her symptoms for profit. \u2018She is a high achiever who has worked extremely hard throughout her life,\u2019 he said. \u2018She left school at 17 with ten GCSEs to pursue a career in theatre lighting and media, and she is, plainly, a capable, driven and ambitious woman with proven business skills, and a talented photographer who has been the driving force behind the success of CCP.\u2019 He said that despite the effect of the delayed surgery, Mrs Tait had tried to continue her photographic business and complete the first year of a Masters degree at Birmingham City University. \u2018To my mind these are not the character traits or indeed the actions of a malingerer or someone who is out to exaggerate her claim for financial gain,\u2019 he said. Judge McKenna awarded Mrs Tait \u00a3140,000 for her pain and suffering and loss of amenity, with the balance made up of past and future care and loss of earnings. As well as paying \u00a32.4million in damages, the trust must also pay legal costs estimated at \u00a31.2million. The trust\u2019s counsel, Robert Seabrook QC, said \u2018continuous efforts\u2019 were made to improve procedures and standards at its hospitals. He also expressed the trust\u2019s \u2018deep sympathy\u2019 to Mrs Tait for the \u2018terrible injuries she has suffered\u2019. Mrs Tait said as she left court: 'I'm pleased that it is finally over.'",

        "document": "The grieving family of a Turkish prosecutor who died after being shot in the head and chest during courthouse siege wept over his coffin at his funeral today. Thousands of people gathered on the streets of Istanbul to pay their respects to Mehmet Selim Kiraz, who died yesterday after the six-hour stand-off. His coffin was covered with the Turkish flag for his funeral at Eyup Sultan Mosque in Istanbul. Mr Kiraz died in hospital after the members of the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front stormed into the office and took him hostage. It is not known who fired the fatal shots. Scroll down for video . Threat: The Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front published disturbing photographs of the terrified prosecutor with a gun to his head on their official Facebook page before he was shot . Grief: The family of Mehmet Selim Kiraz grive over his coffin during his funeral at Eyup Sultan Mosque in Istanbul, Turkey. He died in hospital after he was taken hostage by the far-left organisation . Mourning: The coffin of the prosecutor was passed through the crowds of mourners gathered to pay their respects. He had been leading an investigation into the death of teenager\u00a0Berkin Elvan, who died aged 15 . Two of his captors were killed after security forces took back the building where the far-left group were holding him. Gunshots were heard and smoke could be seen rising from the scene at the end of the six-hour stand-off. Turkish authorities on Wednesday detained 22 suspected members of the group in the southern city of Antalya after receiving a tip-off they were planning further attacks, the Dogan news agency reported. Meanwhile hundreds of lawyers, prosecutors and staff stood in respect on every floor of the giant Istanbul Caglayan Palace of Justice where Kiraz worked and the hostage drama unfolded. 'We will not forget you, our martyr,' read a gigantic banner, as a huge Turkish flag was hung from the top floor. The courthouse is to be renamed after Kiraz. Respect: Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu (L), the son of killed prosecutor Mehmet Selim Kiraz (C) and Turkish National Assembly President Cemil Cicek (R) stand by Kiraz' coffin in Istanbul . Gathering: Prosecutors, lawyers and judges stand near a statue of Lady Justice during the funeral ceremony . Defiant: Mourners at the funeral of Kiraz hold a picture of the prosecutor high in tribute to the lawyer . Mr Kiraz was targeted for his part in an investigation into the death of Berkin Elvan. The 15-year-old was severely wounded after being hit on the head by a tear-gas canister fired by a police officer during anti-government protests in Istanbul in June 2013. After spending 269 days in a coma, Elvan eventually died on March 11 last year. His death, and the subsequent investigation, have since become a rallying point for the country's far-Left. Police chief Selami Alt\u0131nok said officers stormed the building on Tuesday after hearing gunshots, and killed two of the gunmen. Critical: Prosecutor Mehmet Selim Kiraz was taken to hospital with gunshot wounds but died of his injuries . Shattered: The broken window of the room where prosecutor\u00a0Mehmet Selim Kiraz was held hostage and shot . 'We carried out the negotiation for six hours. But our security forces launched the operation after gunshots were heard while terrorists were speaking on the phone during the negotiation,' he said. The emergency began at 2.36pm local time (12.36 GMT) when members of the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front stormed into the office of Mr Kiraz. Images of a masked militant holding a gun to Mr Kiraz's head were then posted on the group's Facebook page, along with a demand for police to confess on live TV within the hour. Armed police rushed to the scene and were shown escorting court officials out of the building, but there was no sign of Mr Kiraz before the deadline arrived and live TV feeds were cut. Shots were then heard from inside the building, according to the Dogan news agency. Standing guard:\u00a0Members of security forces stand outside the main courthouse in Istanbul during the siege . Horror: The prosecutor was leading an investigation into the death of 15-year-old Berkin Elvan . Protesters:\u00a0Turkish police use water cannons to disperse protesters who expressed support for an alleged militant member of the banned leftist group DHKP-C group who took Turkish Mehmet Selim Kiraz hostage . In a statement published by Turkish media, the hostage taking was claimed by the Marxist Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front, which has been behind a string of recent attacks. The group published pictures showing one of the militants - his face concealed by a scarf with the group's red and yellow insignia - holding a gun to Kiraz's head. They had also plastered their flags and posters on the walls of his office. Turkish media said that the group had given a deadline of 3:36 pm (13.36 BST) for the prosecutor to identify the police officers who they say were behind the killing of Elvan or he would be shot. Emergency: An ambulance leaves the courthouse after police storm the building. Mr Kiraz was taken to hospital where he died from his injuries . Over: Istanbul Security Chief Selami Altinok, centre-right, and Deputy Chief Prosecutor Orhan Kapici speak to the media outside the main courthouse in Istanbul at the end of the siege . In a brief video message on a widely-followed Twitter account describing itself as that of Elvan's family, his father appeared to call on the group not to harm the prosecutor. 'We want justice. We don't want anyone to shed even a drop of blood. We don't want other mothers to cry,' Sami Elvan said. Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu met with the current and former interior and justice ministers at the ruling AK Party headquarters in Ankara to discuss the hostage taking, officials in his office said. The DHKP-C said on its website it wanted the police officer it blames for Elvan's death to 'confess' on television, the officers involved to be tried in 'people's courts', and charges against those who attended protests for Elvan to be dropped. The DHKP-C blames the ruling AK Party for the killing of teenager Elvan. Moving in: Armed police massed outside the Istanbul courthouse . Rushed to safety: Court officials were seen being escorted to safety by armed police . Gunshots: According to the\u00a0Dogan news agency, gunshots were heard from inside the building after the militant group's deadline passed . Demands: The group were demanding that Mr Kiraz name the policemen implicated in Mr Elvan's death, which has become a rallying point for the country's far-left . He was aged 15 at the time of his death, which was followed by mass nationwide protests that were also largely put down by the police. Elvan has since become an icon for the Turkish far-left and his supporters accuse the authorities of covering up the circumstances and perpetrators of his death. The United States, European Union and Turkey list the DHKP-C as a terrorist organisation. It was behind a suicide bombing at the U.S. Embassy in 2013. In 2001, two policemen and an Australian tourist died in a DHKP-C attack in central Istanbul. Innocent: Berkin was on his way to buy bread during anti-government street protests when he was struck in the head by a high-velocity gas canister . Strength of feeling: Elvan has since become an icon for the Turkish far-left and his supporters accuse the authorities of covering up the circumstances and perpetrators of his death .",

        "document": "(CNN)Boko Haram, the Nigeria-based Islamist terror group, has pledged allegiance to ISIS, according to an audio message purported to be from Boko Haram's leader, Abubakar Shekau. In the audio, which was posted online Saturday, the speaker says Boko Haram is announcing its \"allegiance to the Caliph of the Muslims, Ibrahim ibn Awad ibn Ibrahim al-Husseini al-Qurashi,\" which is another name for ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. CNN has not been able to independently authenticate the message. But Jacob Zenn, an expert on the terror group and is with the Jamestown Foundation, said the recording appeared to be authentic. He said that while other messages have been faked, the speaker in this one is Shekau. \"Boko Haram joining the ISIS fold makes sense to both groups,\" he said from Abuja, Nigeria. \"Boko Haram will get legitimacy, which will help its recruiting, funding and logistics as it expands into (French-speaking) West Africa. It will also get guidance from ISIS in media warfare and propaganda. Previously Boko Haram was a sort of outcast in the global Jihadi community. Now it is perhaps ISIS's biggest affiliate. \"ISIS gets more international legitimacy as a global caliphate.\" Zenn said the allegiance will be official when an ISIS leader such as spokesman Abu Mohammed al Adnani issues a statement. Boko Haram has had two main factions -- one led by Shekau and the other comprising former members of  Ansaru, a Boko Haram offshoot. Ansaru had been operating from around 2012 as the Nigerian wing of AQIM (al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb). After the French-led intervention in Mali in 2013, a significant number of Ansaru members re-integrated with Shekau, Zenn told CNN. The prerequisite for Boko Haram joining ISIS coalition was a coming together of two factions. ISIS connected with former Ansaru fighters within Boko Haram and pressed them to further unify the group's ranks. The result was the formation of a unity general command between the two factions. That involved bridging of some ideological differences between the al Qaeda-like Ansaru and the ultra extreme \"takfiri\"-like Shekau. The pledge follows a period during which Shekau's faction had been mimicking ISIS, including praising al-Baghdadi and featuring his image in their videos and photos. Zenn said that until recently there had been little feedback from ISIS, apart from a few references to Nigerian jihadis in recent issues of the English-language Dabiq magazine. It appears that a month ago ISIS set up a Twitter account on which Saturday's message was linked, Zenn said. The Twitter handle was mutually promoted by Boko Haram and ISIS. In July, Shekau voiced support for ISIS, and declared a overtaken town in northeast Nigeria to be part of an Islamic caliphate. But he also said he was praying for al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri and Taliban leader Mullah Omar. U.S. intelligence officials have some doubts the two groups would get along. The CIA's analysis has been that Boko Haram is very African and rooted in that region's Islamic practices, even if they have similar fundamentalist interpretations of Islam.  And ISIS's Arab leadership and membership tends to have racist attitudes toward blacks, not unlike the society they come from. ISIS leaders view Shekau as inferior, partly for racist reasons, the CIA indicated at a briefing for reporters. Boko Haram, whose name translates as \"Western education is sin,\" has been waging a yearslong campaign of terror aimed at instituting its extreme version of Sharia law. Boko Haram's tactics have intensified in recent years, from battling Nigerian government soldiers to acts disproportionately affecting civilians -- such as raids on villages, mass kidnappings, assassinations, market bombings and attacks on churches and unaffiliated mosques. Much of this violence has taken place in Nigeria. But neighboring countries, such as Cameroon and Chad, have also been hit increasingly hard. CNN's Steve Almasy and Evan Perez contributed to this story.",

        "document": "Chef: Police think Claudia Lawrence was murdered . The detective leading the search for missing chef Claudia Lawrence revealed last night he is \u2018actively pursuing new leads\u2019 on the sixth anniversary of her disappearance. Detective Superintendent Dai Malyn, of North Yorkshire Police, said his team had made \u2018significant progress\u2019 since the force began reviewing the case in 2013 and may make more arrests in the coming weeks and months. He warned anyone who had not yet disclosed details about their relationship with the chef or the events in the days leading up to her disappearance to come forward or risk arrest. Miss Lawrence was last seen on March 18, 2009, and reported missing by her father on March 20 after concerns were raised when she failed to turn up for her 6am shift at York University. Police believe she was murdered. A number of new searches have been carried out since 2013, including a detailed re-examination of Miss Lawrence's house in Heworth, York, and a fingertip search of the alleyway that leads to the back of her home. A 60-year-old man was arrested last year in connection with her disappearance and suspected murder but was later released without charge, while a 47-year-old man remains on bail on suspicion of perverting the course of justice. Mr Malyn said: \u2018In the months since we started our review, we have made very significant progress. We have arrested and interviewed two men about Claudia's disappearance. More arrests possible: Detective Superintendent Dai Malyn (pictured), of North Yorkshire Police, said his team had made \u2018significant progress\u2019 since the force began reviewing the case in 2013 . Fingertip search: Mr Malyn said he believes the alleyway near Miss Lawrence's home in the Heworth area of York has \u2018potential significance\u2019 in explaining what happened to the chef and is still being investigated . 'One remains on bail while our inquiries in relation to him continue. In the coming weeks and months we may make additional arrests as we continue to develop our lines of inquiry. \u2018In the light of information that has only recently come to the fore, we are actively pursuing what are rightly described as new leads.\u2019 Mr Malyn said he believes the alleyway has \u2018potential significance\u2019 in explaining what happened to Miss Lawrence and is still being investigated. The detective said some people locally knew Miss Lawrence but have kept their relationship secret and some have deliberately lied about a number of issues concerning their association with the chef, who was 35 at the time. Appeal: Miss Lawrence was last seen in March 2009, and was reported missing by her father Peter (above) Probe: Police believe Miss Lawrence - seen on CCTV on her way home from work in 2009 - was murdered . Map: She did not arrive for a shift at York University . He said: \u2018I would make a further appeal for those to come forward now and provide these explanations. \u2018If I reach the point where we believe people continue to obstruct this investigation or assist or cover up for the person or persons responsible, they will be arrested.\u2019 Mr Malyn continued: \u2018Six years have passed since Claudia disappeared. \u2018For her loved ones, the pain caused by her absence and the circumstances of her disappearance has not faded. 'And nor, I assume, has the guilt and knowledge that one or more people have about what happened to this young woman.' He added: \u2018Ultimately, we may not be able to prove what happened to Claudia, or be able to find her. 'But that will not be for lack of determination, tenacity and meticulous detective work, nor whilst there are still clues that need to be investigated. \u2018If you know what happened to Claudia, or know that you have some relevant information but have not yet come forward, then do so, today. \u2018Six years is a long time to live with that knowledge.\u2019",

        "document": "(CNN)There are many things that immigrants could teach those of us who are U.S.-born. The biggest lesson may simply to be grateful for our rights and privileges. That includes the little things we take for granted. Like a small plastic card that not only allows us to drive on public roadways but also provides us a sense of identity. Imagine not having a driver's license and not being able to obtain one because the government prohibits it. Erika Andiola doesn't have to imagine. Until recently, the 27-year-old Phoenix resident and co-director of the Arizona Dream Coalition was barred from having a driver's license by Arizona. The reason: she is an undocumented immigrant born in Mexico and brought here as a child by her mother. Given that she arrived in the United States when she was 11 and has lived on this side of the U.S.-Mexico border longer than she lived on the other side, Andiola considers herself an American and this country her home. Under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which was initiated by the Obama administration, more than half a million undocumented youth were given a two-year reprieve from deportation and a work permit. Andiola is one of the recipients, having been granted DACA protection in November 2012 and a renewal since then. From that point, had she lived in another state, the process for getting a driver's license might have been much smoother. But she lives in Arizona, which -- in the 20 years from 1989 to 2009 -- welcomed illegal immigrants and their labor to build homes in Phoenix, work in restaurants in Tucson and make beds at ski lodges in Flagstaff but then tried to expel them when their chores were done. To push them out the door, legislators passed a spiteful law in 2010 that roped local police into enforcing federal immigration statutes and essentially sanctioned ethnic profiling of Latinos. In August 2012, on the same day that DACA took effect, Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer issued an executive order preventing the program's recipients from obtaining driver's licenses or other public \"benefit.\" Brewer's order was challenged in court. Two years later, in July 2014, a three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals struck down the Arizona policy as a violation of the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution. With that, the estimated 22,000 DACA recipients who are also residents of the Grand Canyon State were free to apply for driver's licenses and take their driving tests like anyone else. Andiola got her Arizona license earlier this month, after paying a $25 fee that she'll have to pay every two years each time she renews it. I wondered what traveling that road taught her about that piece of plastic she carries with her. And I was curious about whether she had given any thought to how the native-born see driver's licenses compared to people like her. \"There is a pretty big difference,\" Andiola said. \"I think it's because we fought really hard for it. People born here might not ever think about their driver's license unless they buy a drink or get stopped by police. For us, it's a reminder of the fruits of our labor. Think about how many minds we had to change so people could come out of the shadows.\" Other privileges get taken for granted by the native-born, she said, such as the ability to apply for financial aid to attend college or pay the lower in-state tuition that you're entitled to pay as a state resident. \"When it comes to higher education, I don't think a lot of people really understand what they have unless they have to struggle to get it,\" Andiola said. \"I have nephews who are citizens. I'm trying to make them understand how it was such a big deal, in my case, to attend college and pay in-state tuition and have it taken away. It was a big hurdle, and I almost dropped out. I want them to understand some of the privileges they have.\" Finally, there's the right to vote. Undocumented immigrants can't do it, and yet many of those U.S. citizens who can don't bother going to the polls. \"Look at what we've done to bring change,\" she said. \"Imagine how much someone can accomplish when they vote. A lot of Americans don't learn the political process. And you don't feel you need to until you struggle to drive, to vote, to just be allowed to stay with your family.\" Listen to her, America. This is an exemplary country, and it'll stay that way as long as those of us who were born here and have these rights and privileges learn to appreciate them, treat them with care and put them to good use.",

        "document": "(CNN)The image of the braided Kurdish female fighter, donning military camouflage and taking up arms against the militant group ISIS, may have done more to promote the Kurdish cause in the West than anything else in recent years. The Iraqi Kurds have long been pro-Western in orientation, but Western powers have often only moderately addressed their pleas for support, in part out of fear of empowering the secessionist minority to seek independence. Now, with soccer moms in Middle America tweeting photos of Kurdish female fighters, Western governments may find it harder to explain their tepid Kurdish policies to their constituencies. Jacob Russell's sensitive photo essay brings much-needed nuance to the recent proliferation of images of Kurdish female fighters. Since last summer, international media -- and Kurdish politicians who have recognized the public relations value of the images -- often objectified these women. Images of smiling young female fighters brandishing weapons with a hint of glamour (\"girls with guns,\" as Russell calls this type of portrayal) tend to portray more of the photographer's assumptions about the woman's emancipation than her actual experiences as a Kurdish woman in combat. Russell consciously avoids this uncomplicated portrayal of female fighters. \"I was wary of making images that fed into this idea of the heroic strong women fighters,\" he said. \"I think that the female fighters are used quite cynically by Kurdish leaders (who) know very well how attractive this image is to the Western media.\" Having lived in Kurdistan for nearly two years, Russell understands that many women join the Peshmerga or other Kurdish forces for unglamorous reasons. Many of the women he photographed turned to the Peshmerga to escape abusive marriages or other forms of repression women continue to face there. Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. \"A lot of the women's backstories were quite difficult,\" he said. \"It seemed like this unit provided an alternative network for women who maybe would struggle in normal Kurdish society, because despite being relatively progressive (within the Middle East), it is still quite a conservative society.\" Russell explores the theme of sisterhood, and in one image he captures the women in an intimate moment in the back of a pickup truck, their fingers intertwined. That photo, he says, is his favorite from the shoot. \"I think that image is one of the more expressive ones that (shows) what really seems to be going on there,\" he said. \"I didn't want to take pictures that conveyed the idea that this was all about hardcore fighters going into battle and killing lots of (ISIS) fighters. That just didn't seem to be the case.\" Russell remarks that the image of the female fighter carries an important social role, conveying to the world the (relatively) progressive values that Kurds pride themselves on. The women now serve a political role, too. As Western governments eye more military engagement with Kurdish forces in Iraq and Syria, these women may boost the Kurds' international standing.

        "document": "Winston Churchill planned to tempt America into joining World War Two by offering the country a priceless copy of the Magna Carta. The British Cabinet believed the gesture would sway US public opinion in favour of joining the fighting in Europe, and even set a date for the handover before the deal fell through. Never-before-seen letters reveal the wartime government discussed how Americans are desperate for 'tangible evidence of their European background', meaning the gift would be of particular value. Letters written in 1941 reveal Churchill planned to gift the US a copy of the Magna Carta to persuade them to join World War Two, noting that Americans desire 'tangible evidence of their European background' The Magna Carta, which was issued by King John in 1215 establishing the rule of law and handing rights to his subjects, is also seen as a precursor to the American Constitution. In 1941, when the letters were written, a copy of the document was stranded in America following the outbreak of the war while it was on display at the New York World's Fair in 1939. The US government had already signed a deal sending vast amounts of aid money over to their struggling allies in Europe, but were still reticent about engaging in the fighting themselves. According to the letters, which go on display at the British Library from this Friday, the Americans saw the British as 'cold-blooded', 'calculating' people who failed 'to say it with flowers' The historic document (pictured), which signed over righta King John's people, is viewed as a precursor to the American constitution, and so was viewed as a generous gift . In an attempt to win them over, the British Cabinet, supported by Churchill, planned to gift them the copy of the Magna Carta, which belonged to Lincoln Cathedral. The letters, reported in The Independent, say: 'A friendly act, graciously performed, evokes a tremendous response; when an American has his emotions stirred, his generosity is unbounded. 'He will give the shirt off his back for friendship.' Officials even scheduled June 15 of that year as the day for the document to be handed over, but the deal fell through for unspecified reasons.

        "document": "Some of us are not obvious cruisers. I have an irrational fear of death by drowning and can't bear the thought of eating three meals a day, every day. So the prospect of a 16-day voyage round New Zealand to Australia is alarming. Will I survive? Or will I disappear overboard, laden with food, the heavyweight victim of some marine disaster? New Zealand is a living geography lesson - a country strewn with mountains, fjords, forests, glaciers, and lakes, home to the dolphin, whale, penguin, albatross, seal and sea-lion (there is a difference: the latter eat the former for breakfast). A place to pause: The tiny port of Picton is a gateway to the winelands of New Zealand's Marborough region . Home, too, to the beautiful blue agapanthus flower and the crimson-flowered pohutukawa, the New Zealand Christmas tree. And you can get oysters everywhere. It's a long journey to New Zealand, so make sure you find somewhere to recover. The Boatshed on Waiheke Island, a short ferry ride from Auckland, is perfect - a boutique hotel on the water where you can begin your acquaintance with this faraway land. I'm taken on an exhilarating ride around the bay on a Harley Davidson - 1800cc of shiny, macho metal. 'Have you ridden an HD before?' asks my hunky 'chauffeur'. No, but I used to have a Lambretta 125. Coming back for more: A high percentage of people on the Seabourn Odyssey are returning passengers . 'Just lean when I lean,' he says. I cling to his leathered waist and watch the world go by at speed. My cruising worries begin to evaporate when I meet the crew of Seabourn Odyssey. 'Welcome home,' they say as we embark - a curious choice of words, until you realise more than half the passengers are returnees. In our ship-shape suite, everything is sparklingly clean (as a woman who enjoys scrubbing her front steps, I notice these things). Captain Cook charted the coastline of New Zealand 245 years ago. As well as unpredictable seas, he feared scurvy, caused by a lack of Vitamin C, which leads to suppurating wounds, loss of teeth and ultimately death. No danger of that on the Odyssey. I can't think of another period in my life when I've eaten so well, so consistently. Cook pulped plants to make vitamin beer and fed his men sauerkraut; I sip a glass of champagne and nibble a canap\u00e9. That night the whoosh of waves against the hull lulls me to sleep. Taken for a ride: Sue took a tour of Waiheke island in speedy two-wheeled style - on a Harley Davidson . The ship has 450 passengers, 11 decks, four restaurants, a spa, fitness centre, swimming pool, hot tubs everywhere and a theatre larger than Cook's ship. On day one, we disembark andhead for Rotorua and its strange geothermal pools. 'Tours4Matures' says a minibus sign \u2014 a reminder of the age profile. We hire a car and drive to see bubbling mud, hot volcanic craters and hissing ochre and green waters. But why would you take a bath in mud and risk getting it where even the soap can't reach? We get lost driving back and nearly miss the sailing. Independence comes at a price. Crossing the Cook Strait to South Island, we anchor at the tiny port of Picton and take an excursion into the Marlborough High Country, to a remote sheep station where we meet Hailey Pitts. She and her husband Jeremy farm 20,000 acres and rear 5,000 sheep. It's a hard life, but their shining eyes are proof that they adore it. As we cruise through Queen Charlotte Sound, said to be Captain Cook's favourite anchorage, peace envelops me. I sit on our veranda watching the sun fade across the islands around us. What a long way from the remote outdoors of that sheep station. Idyllic: Waiheke island sits on Auckland's doorstep - but feels far removed from New Zealand's biggest city . Ah, well - what's for dinner? In Akaroa, we see Hector's dolphin, the smallest and rarest in the world. In Port Chalmers, we climb up to a memorial to Captain Robert Scott. He set sail from there in 1910 on his illfated journey to the South Pole. The sunset is spectacular that night and I think of Captain Scott and his companions as the red ball in the sky disappears, leaving behind a trail of light, first pink, then orange, then burgundy, until finally blackness falls. (Trying to describe a sunset is like trying to describe sex - it always sounds trite. Let's just say it was moving.) On south, until we hit the last land before the South Pole, the beautiful Stewart Island. Due west - nothing but sea until the tip of South America. Due east - ditto. It's time to turn and head out to Australia. It's nearly 1,300 miles from the bottom of New Zealand across the Tasman Sea to Melbourne. Gale force winds mean the ship can make only slow progress as it tries to avoid pitching heavily into the waves. My irrational fears return. The crossing takes three long days and nights, But I come to realise how a big ship like the Odyssey can cope with such seas. I relax into the camaraderie that develops on board, and at long last we're cruising into Melbourne and then along the coast to Sydney. Calm comforts: Picton is a haven for sailors who have crossed the often rough waters of the Cook Strait . At 6am on a beautiful summer's morning, the Opera House and the Harbour Bridge welcome us to a city full of promise. That afternoon, I watch from my hotel window as the Seabourn Odyssey sets sail once more, back to Auckland. Now someone else is in suite 722. Someone else is being made to feel this is a voyage designed only for them. I confess to feeling proprietorial and not a little emotional. I must be a cruiser. A 16-day Australia and New Zealand cruise on the Seabourn Encore (0843 373 2000, seabourn.com), departing on February 2, 2017, costs from \u00a37,999 per person, based on two people sharing.

        "document": "A major player in online travel has finally 'fallen into line' by removing excess credit card charges two years after the Royal Bank of Australia ruled that surcharges should be limited to \u2018reasonable costs\u2019. Online booking agent Wotif confirmed\u00a0they are dumping their $5.50 hotel booking fee which could put some $20 million dollars back into the pockets of Australian consumers. They are also removing credit card costs and surcharges on full service flights that would have set consumers back $16.95 however they will keep a surcharge on low cost airlines of $9.95 per person. Wotif have dumped excess booking fees which could save Australians $20 million a year . While Wotif has been praised for the move, consumers who expected to see a drop in prices  may be disappointed as the company is believed to have increased the commission levied on accommodation for bookings made via its website from 12 to 15 per cent, reported\u00a0Newscorp. Tom Godfrey thinks there needs to be a regulatory body to stop companies from charging exorbitant prices for using a credit card or booking online . Tom Godfrey from CHOICE told Daily Mail Australia that an increase in commission prices could be an effort to further 'fleece' customers in a bid to offset losses from dropping the controversial credit card fees. Wotif said the change is not a bid to recoup costs lost by the surcharge but a reflection on their recent acquisition by competing company Expedia. Mr Godfrey said the rise in commission will increase up front costs of travel however the removal of the credit card surcharging is win for consumers and a clear warning to other companies who continue to \u2018flout\u2019 the ban on excessive charges. \u2018It\u2019s great to see consumers unite to drive change because it sends clear signal to businesses that we aren't happy.\u2019 He said excessive credit card charges are costing Australian\u2019s over a billion dollars a year, with some of the \u2018worst offenders\u2019 being Qantas, Jetstar, Virgin and Tiger. \u2018People are sick and tired of being ripped off by the top end of town,' he said. Klaus Bartosch, the business man responsible for an anti surcharge petition that's been signed by over 100,000 people, welcomes the change and agrees this move puts more pressure on other major players to respond to 'consumer sentiment' by removing 'outrageous fees'. 'No where else in the world does this exist,' he said. Mr Bartosch started an online petition to stop airlines and travel companies from taking advantage of consumers by charging 'ridiculous' amounts for using credit cards . Mr Bartosch said prices are 'misleading' and not an accurate reflection of what businesses are actually paying to use credit cards. 'They are just plucking these figures from their backsides to rip of consumers,' he told Daily Mail Australia. CHOICE recently released a report that shows merchants are only paying around 0.8 per cent for Visa and Mastercard and 2 per cent for prestige cards like America Express and Diners Club. According to the latest research data made available by MasterCard, Australian consumers are being surcharged about $1.6 billion each year. Qantas, Tiger, Jetstar and Virgin continue to flout the ban on excessive credit card surcharges . Mr Bartosch believes these numbers prove that Australian's are facing excessive surcharges and that companies 'can not be trusted to self regulate'. CHOICE have also called for a regulator who have explicit legal power to limit credit card surcharges. According to Mr Godfrey excessive surcharging needs to be regulated by a body with the power to demand evidence of fair pricing and subsequently enforce significant penalties for non compliance. 'For too long hotels and airlines have been thumbing their nose at the government and there needs to be a regulatory body who have more power to enforce the ban,' Mr Godfrey said.",

        "document": "Kim Sears waited eight years for a proposal from Andy Murray, Mariah Carey accepted Nick Cannon\u2019s offer of marriage after one month. How long it takes you to get married is entirely individual but when one person is gagging to get up the aisle and the other has no intention of going there, there are clearly questions that need answering. Staying with someone who\u2019s using you as a stop-gap until their \u2018true\u2019 love comes along isn\u2019t healthy; staying with someone who loves you but doesn\u2019t want to get married for justifiable reasons is entirely different. Tracey Cox reveals the signs to look out for to work out whether your partner is 'the one' But how do you know who\u2019s holding out for better and who\u2019s genuine, albeit marriage shy? There are the seven key questions to consider, according to relationship therapists - and two you need to ask yourself. 1. What\u2019s their background and relationship history? It is often used as an excuse but the \u2018I don\u2019t believe in the institution of marriage - it\u2019s just a \u2018piece of paper\u2019\u2019 is understandable if based on past experience. A previous failed marriage can make people cynical about a repeat performance. If your partner\u2019s parents had a toxic marriage, treated each other badly and were desperately unhappy, it\u2019s hardly surprising they\u2019re not keen to follow in their footsteps. Their fear isn\u2019t about getting married, it\u2019s fear of it ending in a messy, painful divorce. Are they happy discussing marriage even if not happy doing it? If you can\u2019t sit down and have an open, honest discussion with someone you love about something that is important to you, you shouldn\u2019t be marrying them in the first place. If a partner refuses to even talk through the topic, it shows a distinct lack of interest in you and your feelings which isn\u2019t a great indicator for a healthy, long-term relationship. 2. Can they tell you the reason why they\u2019re not interested? It\u2019s a huge red flag if their answer to \u2018Why don\u2019t you want to marry me?\u201d is \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d. Usually one of two things is going on. They\u2019re avoiding telling the truth - they don\u2019t want to marry you - or it suggests a lack of self-awareness and ability to articulate feelings. Neither are indicative of a healthy functioning relationship. 3. Do they have a problem with the actual ceremony? One couple I knew nearly split because the guy refused to discuss marriage even though he was desperately in love with his partner. He nearly lost her before admitting that, as a shy person, the thought of being the centre of attention and having to make a speech in front of dozens of people scared him witless. Think about anything else about the ceremony they might be dreading. 4. Does the thought of all their family being together in one room make them want to run for the hills? Tracey says that being to optimistic could be a sign that your relationship is in danger . Offer up some alternatives - a registry office, garden party with a few friends, just the two of you away somewhere, writing your own vows instead of repeating words that might mean nothing to them - and see what response you get. 5. Is it about money? I\u2019m not just talking about who will finance the wedding but what happens after that. Men, particularly, will often put off getting married until they feel financially secure. Even they intellectually know we live in (more) equal times, that inbuilt male desire to want to provide can kick in with the most \u2018feminised\u2019 man at times like this. 6. Are they worried getting married might ruin a good relationship? We\u2019ve all heard of couples who finally marry after more than a decade only to split a few months later. Usually this is because the relationship was failing and getting married was a last-ditch attempt to save it, given all the history shared. But to someone who is thoroughly enjoying the relationship they have now, seeing others fail is a reason to be nervous. Why fix it, if it isn\u2019t broken?, they reason. Some personalities are better suited to living together than marriage. Some see marriage as security, comfort, an expression of deep and lasting love. Others see it as suffocating, claustrophobic and stifling. They might be very happy to live with you forever without being formally \u2018forced\u2019 to stay but find the thought of \u2018having\u2019 to stay unappealing. 7. Are they happy committing, if not getting married? Don\u2019t confuse marriage with commitment. Plenty of couples are committed to each other without being married and being married doesn\u2019t ensure your partner will be committed (or faithful). If they\u2019ll happily chat about things like buying houses, planning holidays, looking after parents in later life and other things that will tie you together for an awfully long time, they have a problem with marriage, not committing to you and your relationship. If your partner clearly loves you, is committed for life but just doesn\u2019t want to get married, does it really matter? Why is marriage important to you? There are many reasons to want to get married. Be honest with yourself about what your motivation is. Do you want to get married for moral or religious reasons? Are you jealous and want to make sure others know your partner\u2019s off limits? Are you doing it because all your friends are and you feel left out? Do you want to send an \u2018I\u2019m over you alright!\u2019 message to an ex? Or do you fancy a big party with all your friends and a chance to show off? Are you doing it to boost your self-esteem? The high of planning a wedding and being the envy of others who\u2019d also like to be getting married, works wonders to prop up sagging self-confidence. Until, of course, the wedding is over and everything reverts straight back to what it was with no problem solved and one created if you realise you\u2019re married to the wrong person. How healthy is your relationship? The worst reason of all to get married is thinking it will fix an floundering relationship. Are you pushing for it too soon? If you\u2019ve been together less than six months, it\u2019s more \u2018What are you thinking?\u2019 than \u2018Slow down\u2019. Yes, of course there are exceptions of couples who marry weeks into their relationship and remain blissfully happy years later. But there are more couples who fall into the \u2018marry in haste, repent in leisure\u2019 category. What\u2019s the rush, anyway, if you\u2019re going to be together forever? Most research on marital happiness suggests couples who\u2019ve been together 18 months before getting engaged, then marry within a year, have the best chance at lasting long-term. Statistics are statistics and not always right but this does provide a good yardstick to measure your eagerness by. If you\u2019re suggesting marriage way earlier than most people and your partner\u2019s baulking at the idea, this may actually mean they\u2019re more serious about you, than you are them. While there\u2019s an undeniable romantic appeal to the notion of \u2018love at first sight\u2019, is it not more romantic (not to mention sensible) to give your marriage the best possible chance to succeed by waiting a little?",

        "document": "Phil Jagielka has warned Everton team-mate Ross Barkley that he will have to wait patiently for a place in England\u2019s midfield. Barkley was still only 19 years old when he made his England debut in September 2013 and set pulses racing with some of his performances for Everton last season which earned him a place at last summer\u2019s World Cup in Brazil. But this campaign the 21-year-old has struggled for the same kind of form and, despite winning 10 England caps already, does not currently appear to be in Roy Hodgson\u2019s first-team plans. Barkley has been played in multiple positions for club and country and Everton manager Roberto Martinez has experimented the most with him out on the wing, as an attacking central midfielder or further back in the middle. Ross Barkley may have to wait for his chance to impress with England, according to team-mate Phil Jagielka . Jagielka spoke on Wednesday about his club team-mate's progress in what has been a difficult season . The Everton skipper said he believed Barkley would have to bide his time and wait for an opportunity . \u2018I think Ross will have to bide his time,\u2019 Jagielka, who is his club captain, said. \u2018And when he does get the opportunities for England, keep playing the way he has, keep playing well, keep being positive and hopefully when he gets that chance to play in two or three games on the spin, that is his chance keep the shirt and make it much harder for someone to take it off him. \u2018It is difficult with the position he would try to get in the team in. We have got a fantastic amount of midfielders that come away with England and quite a lot who want to play in a similar position.\u2019 One player almost certain of a starting place in the crunch games is goalkeeper Joe Hart. After being dropped by Manchester City earlier in the season, he has worked his way back into guaranteed first pick. Barkley has had a difficult season with Everton after a brilliant breakthrough campaign last year . That season resulted in a World Cup call-up, and Barkley looked a bright spark against Costa Rica . Earlier in England's group, Barkley congratulates Wayne Rooney after coming on against Uruguay . That culminated in his stand-out performance against Barcelona, in which Lionel Messi described him as \u2018phenomenal\u2019 even though he could not prevent City going out of the Champions League. Jagielka, Barkley and the rest of their Everton team-mates watched the match in Kiev ahead of their Europa League tie. \u2018We were pretty much laughing at the performance from Joe,\u2019 Jagielka revealed. \u2018It was just one of those nights. \u2019It is sometimes difficult to get the accolades when you're at a big team. It is normally the people scoring the goals and things like that, but when Joe is needed he normally comes up trumps with some fantastic saves or some fantastic decisions in games.' Jagielka said he was 'laughing' at Joe Hart's performance against Barcelona in the Champions League . Hart was in brilliant form to repeatedly deny Lionel Messi and co at the Nou Camp in last week's second leg .",

        "document": "Seyne-les-Alpes, France (CNN)It's a dangerous task as well as a grim one. The rescue workers battling to gather the pulverized pieces of Germanwings Flight 9525 and the remains of the 150 people on board must contend with high winds as well as treacherous terrain. They climb up a rugged mountain, appearing to cling to its side by their fingernails. Bit by bit, bag by bag, high wire daredevils hoist body bags hundreds of feet up to waiting helicopters, trying to remain stable in the high winds.  Rescuers pin red flags on the earth when they discover new fragments. Winched down from helicopters on to the steep, icy slopes, where debris lies scattered across hundreds of meters, workers have had to be tied together in two-person teams. One is there to carry out the investigation and recovery. The second is charged with ensuring their safety as they're buffeted by the weather. Complicating matters, very few of the bodies have been found whole, Yves Naffrechoux, captain of rescue operations, told CNN on Friday. And winds have picked up, making it difficult for helicopters to ferry the workers to the site in the French Alps in the first place, he said. Authorities have deployed 45 Alpine police officers to help forensics teams -- not accustomed to working in mountain ravines -- recover the bodies safely, Naffrechoux said. His team is based out of Seyne-les-Alpes, a normally sleepy Alpine village that since Tuesday's crash has been transformed into a hub for the recovery operation. The leaders of Germany, France and Spain have visited. The families of the victims have laid flowers and prayed at a nearby memorial. Journalists have flocked to the spot as they report the latest developments. Meanwhile, the rescue workers have continued their hazardous mission. Before anything could be recovered, the position of the bodies and debris had to be mapped. Human remains must be treated with due respect despite the tricky conditions. The workers are now removing more bodies from the site, Naffrechoux said. The priority remains to find all the bodies and the elusive second \"black box,\" the plane's flight data recorder, he said. Investigators hope, once found, it could yield more clues into what happened on the flight deck of the Germanwings plane before it slammed into the mountainside at about 430 miles per hour. Already, the Marseille prosecutor, Brice Robin, has revealed that cockpit audio indicated that German co-pilot Andreas Lubitz \"wanted to destroy the aircraft.\" The recovery teams are trying to construct a road to access the site more quickly and aid the transportation of bodies to a DNA testing center where they are kept in refrigerated units, said Naffrechoux. It's hoped the process will take 10 to 15 days, depending on weather, he said. Testimonials posted by France's Interior Ministry from rescue and recovery workers at the scene also give an insight into the tough conditions at the remote crash site. Cmdr. Emmanuel G., of the Criminal Research Institute from the National Gendarmerie, said it was a \"really complicated\" process. \"We are working in two-person teams, whether it's alongside (police) mountain guides, the local gendarmes or the alpine firemen and emergency teams,\" he said. \"We do not know how to continue in this situation otherwise, we really need them to ensure our security at all times.\" \"It's the first time police technicians and gendarmes are working together,\" an unnamed technician in one of those two-person teams is quoted as saying. \"We have total trust in each other. He's holding my life in his hands.\" CNN's Antonia Mortensen and Nic Robertson reported from Seyne-les-Alpes and Laura Smith-Spark wrote and reported from London. CNN's Karl Penhaul,  Ariana Williams and Dheeptika Laurent contributed to this report.",

Richard Williams faces jail after admitting avoiding paying more than \u00a31million in taxman . His replica German U-boat was moored at Clarence Dock in Leeds, when it was raided by Customs officers . Now, the self-confessed maritime history enthusiast - who has toured the waterways of Northern Ireland and northern Britain in his boat - is facing prison after admitting to avoiding more than \u00a31million in taxes. An investigation by HM Revenue and Customs dating back to 2012 found Williams and his former partner Laurel Howarth had set up a number of companies in Lancashire. They ostensibly sold disability equipment to care homes and the NHS, but evidence gathered by investigators showed minimal genuine sales actually took place. Despite this, the pair filed false tax returns and invoices for more than \u00a31million. The self-confessed maritime history enthusiast has admitted spending\u00a0\u00a350,000 kitting out the vessel . The 56-year-old spent the money on naval artefacts, a periscope and dummy torpedoes for the vessel . The 'captain' has toured the waterways of Northern Ireland and northern Britain self-made barge, named\u00a0U-8047 . Both Williams, of Blackpool, Lancashire, and Howarth, 28, formerly of the same address, hijacked the identities of friends and associates in an attempt to hide the fraud. Williams, also known as Stephen Howarth, was charged under the naval title and a series of other aliases he is claimed to have used - after the raid on his self-made barge in January 2012. In May 2011, Williams spoke to the Mail while touring around the Liverpool waterways dressed in full German submarine commander regalia. He told reporters he was a former mobility scooter salesman and had spent more than \u00a350,000 building the U-boat. He also revealed that the boat had been subject to attack from passers-by who thought that he was a Nazi.

Despite this, the filed\u00a0false tax returns and invoices for more than \u00a31million . Sandra Smith, assistant director of criminal investigation at HMRC, said: \u2018Their attempts to extort money from the public purse were brazen and the pair went to great lengths to try and cover their tracks.\u2019 The pair appeared at Manchester Crown Court yesterday having admitted to several charges of fraud. Williams pleaded guilty to three counts of cheating the public revenue and one of having an article used for fraud.\u00a0Howarth has pleaded guilty to three counts of furnishing false returns. They spoke only to confirm their names before the case was adjourned until April in order for reports to be prepared.",

        "document": "Captain Eoin Morgan will not entertain thoughts of a premature World Cup exit even though a nine-wicket defeat by Sri Lanka left England on the brink of disaster. England suffered yet more pain at the Wellington Regional Stadium as centuries from Lahiru Thirimanne and Kumar Sangakkara inspired a record pursuit of 309 for six. Defeat leaves England needing to beat lower-ranked Bangladesh and Afghanistan in their remaining pool games and, even then, it might not be enough to keep them alive. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Cricket World Cup Highlights: England vs Sri Lanka . Eoin Morgan talks to the press after another disappointing defeat for England at the Cricket World Cup . Kumar Sangakkara (centre) hit 117 not out and, alongside Lahiru Thirimanne, put England to the sword . Morgan was not willing to consider the prospect, however, of an early flight home after his side's third loss in four games at the tournament. 'It's not even a thought at the moment,' he said. 'Two games to win to get us into a quarter-final.' Morgan's side never got going in both of those games, but after Joe Root's career-best 121 had put England in the box seat at the half-way stage, the bowlers posed little threat as Thirimanne and Sangakkara embarked on an unbeaten 212-run stand to coast home with 16 balls in hand. 'It definitely is harder to take,' Morgan said. 'When you don't turn up for a race like those first two games it's scratched. Today when we turn up and we're beaten in the fashion we were is harder to take.' One-day captain Morgan (centre) leads England off the pitch in Wellington after their nine-wicket defeat . Thirimanne (left) and Sangakkara helped Sri Lanka to a comfortable win over England in New Zealand . Morgan bemoaned a bowling performance in which he claimed England simply bowled too many bad balls. Thirimanne certainly agreed, after he had suggested in his earlier press conference that batting against England's bowlers had been 'very easy'. The opener was asked to compare England's attack to Afghanistan, who almost pulled off a stunning win over Sri Lanka earlier in the tournament, and said: 'To be honest that day Afghanistan's bowlers did really well but there was a little bit for the seamers. 'Today it was very easy for me to be honest.' Morgan was at a loss to explain why his bowlers were so ineffective and will wait to see a statistical breakdown of England's bowling performance in the next couple of days when they will take time off after flying to Adelaide. Thirimanne plays a shot on the way to scoring a century as Sri Lanka made light work of England's bowlers . Thirimanne is almost down on one knee during his knock (left) as he celebrates with\u00a0Sangakkara (right) 'No. I don't have a theory yet,' he said. 'We bowled a lot of bad balls. Over the next couple of days we'll get the HawkEye stuff back and the proof will be in that. My feeling is we bowled a lot of bad balls.' The skipper denied that the England attack was too predictable in the light of Thirimanne's observations, adding: 'In terms of being too predictable you look at the best sides and they're predictably good. When we're firing we are predictably good. 'We've got two tall guys who are effective, they've got pace and bounce, and two guys who swing the ball and Moeen who does his job. 'When we bowl well we put sides under pressure and create opportunities - today we didn't.' Root celebrates  after reaching a century against Sri Lanka, but it wasn't enough to secure a win for England . Morgan, post-match, did not entertain thoughts of an early exit, instead remaining confident of progression . England were not helped by missing opportunities in the field, most significantly when Root grassed a chance at first slip off Stuart Broad when Thirimanne was on just three. The Sri Lanka openers then put on a century stand to pave the way for a chase that easily broke the previous record at the ground - 254 for four achieved by South Africa against New Zealand three years ago. 'You can talk about the chances we put down. Thirimanne was one,' Morgan said. 'It would have brought Sangakkara to the wicket earlier with more chance of him getting out. He played well. He came in an ideal situation.' England have now been soundly beaten by the three sides ranked higher than them in the group and, should they reach the knockout stages, there is apparently a large gap to be bridged if they are to make any impression. 'Losing any game is always a concern,' Morgan added. James Taylor drops a catch on the boundary as England failed to build on their score in Wellington . Sangakkara and team-mate Thirimanne shake hands with Morgan after Sri Lanka's nine-wicket win . 'Over the next few days, we'll have them off, and then we'll reconvene. Me and Mooresy will have a sit down along with the backroom staff and debrief the game and see where we've gone wrong and how we can get better.' Morgan is confident, though, that he will have no problem in lifting his young squad who now have an eight-day gap to stew over their latest defeat before they meet Bangladesh at the Adelaide Oval. 'It's not a big deal getting those guys up,' he said. 'It's a World Cup everybody is like a kid at Christmas, they want to play and they want to win. That part of it is easy. 'It's simple things moving forward. I keep banging on about them because we haven't done them so far this World Cup. 'The simpler we keep it moving forward, the more obvious what we do or have to do over the next 10 days. That will be the message from me to the players.'",

        "document": "A JetBlue Airways pilot who had to be restrained during a 2012 flight after shouting about Jesus and al-Qaeda  sued for more than $16 million Friday, claiming the airline failed to recognize and address his mental condition. The suit filed by former captain Clayton Osbon three years after his meltdown on a flight from New York to Las Vegas, comes amid increased scrutiny of how major airlines evaluate pilots' mental health in the wake of the allegedly intentional crash of a Germanwings . Osbon, 52, claims in the lawsuit that officials at JetBlue missed several indications that something was wrong with his mental health the day of the flight, noting he missed a pre-flight meeting for the first time in years and arrived to fly disheveled and disoriented. Scroll down for video . Restrained: Clayton Osbon, 52, pictured here being taken off a New York to Las Vegas flight after his breakdown, is suing JetBlue for failing to recognize he was mentally ill . Osbon moved slowly during pre-flight checks for the flight to Las Vegas from New York, and later relieved himself of duty after being told by the first officer he had missed several calls from air traffic control, the lawsuit adds. After a co-pilot locked Osbon out of the cockpit, he 'ran down the aisles screaming and ranting concerning imagined terrorism and the need for all on board on embrace religion.' The lawsuit alleges that JetBlue allowed the flight to continue for three hours and 'unnecessarily endangered the lives of Captain Osbon, the crew and the 135 passengers.' There were no injuries on the flight, which eventually made an emergency landing in Amarillo, Texas. The meltdown resulted from a complex partial brain seizure that 'severely impaired his ability to perform basic activities, caused him to hallucinate, and caused extreme feelings of paranoia and religious fervor,' according to the suit. The lawsuit also alleges the airline routinely ignored crew members' impairment, whether by alcohol, drugs or mental and emotional distress, in order to protect their careers. Hospitalized: Osbon, right, is led out by FBI agents after being released from Northwest Texas hospital in Amarillo following his mid-air breakdown . Veteran captain: Osbon, left, was an experienced pilot but a 'complex partial brain seizure' impaired his brain functions and caused him to hallucinate, according to the lawsuit . Nearly three dozen passengers sued JetBlue in 2012 for being 'grossly negligent' by allowing Osbon to fly with unchecked mental issues. JetBlue eventually settled the lawsuit in April of the following year for an undisclosed sum. After the flight was grounded in Texas, Osbon was indicted on charges of interfering with a flight crew and found not guilty by reason of insanity. Among other conditions of his sentence, Osbon was ordered not to board a commercial or private plane without permission from a probation officer. Osbon remains suspended on medical leave, no longer collecting what once was a more than $300,000 annual salary. The lawsuit states he has not suffered a seizure since beginning a regimen of prescription medication.",

        "document": "(CNN)As more details about the infamous ISIS executioner \"Jihadi John\" become known, certain basic questions continue to be raised. Is Islam as a faith to be blamed for Mohammed Emwazi's voyage to ISIS, otherwise known as the Islamic State? Or is the \"War On Terror\" responsible, and is this merely \"chickens coming home to roost?\" The temptation is to come to simplistic answers. Confronted with such brazen depravity as shown in ISIS propaganda videos, many take what their propagandists say very seriously: That they are, indeed, doing what their faith tells them to do. On the other hand, few believed ISIS when it was claimed they would negotiate with the Japanese authorities to release one of their citizens captured in Syria, who was later killed. Taking ISIS at their word is probably not the most sensible course of action -- it is obviously quite wrong -- and duplicitous -- about a number of things. There have been other neo-religious movements in both Muslim and Christian history. The \"Assassins,\" for example, which began in the 11th century, was a radical, heterodox movement of Muslims, which eventually died out -- in its own time, similar to ISIS today, it was decried and depicted as deviant by Muslim religious authorities as well as most Muslims. Among Christendom, many of the Nazi leadership in the 20th century espoused an ideology called \"Positive Christianity.\" It obviously never attracted much of a following, and historians claim, \"Only a few radicals on the extreme wing of liberal Protestantism would recognize such a mish-mash as true Christianity.\" Why, then, are we not prepared to expunge Islam from the mix when interrogating ISIS ideology? While most churches, Protestant and Catholic, rejected the \"Positive Christianity\" of Nazi Germany, there is no corresponding action from the world of Islam. The problem is, that's not entirely possible. Unlike Christendom, Islam does not admit a hierarchical, ecclesiastical authority -- so, no \"Muslim Church\" or \"Islamic Pope\" exists. Having said that, nevertheless, there are systems of religious authority in Islam. They are more akin to academic peer review structures -- indeed, the concept of the modern university comes from the medieval Muslim seminary. Since the dawn of ISIS, numerous Muslim religious authorities have denounced the claim to authenticity by ISIS, on religious grounds -- none have given it that prize of legitimacy it so craves. That is, except for ISIS itself, and for some odd reason, some in the West who insist on taking ISIS at its word. Religious authorities at large, and Muslims in general, may recognize ISIS members as Muslims, albeit gravely deviant ones who ought to be treated as criminals. Just as Europeans en masse rejected the claims of Anders Breivik, the Norwegian mass killer, who claimed \"Christianity\" as a motivator, without denying he considered himself to be a Christian. In both cases, it is important to understand how this ideology is internally justified, and on what basis, particularly in terms of establishing methods for immunizing vulnerable people from possible recruitment strategies. That doesn't, nevertheless, entail recognizing their claims as accurate -- only that they take them seriously, and others may too. That question of \"vulnerability\" has also been brought up a great deal in the last couple of weeks. There were some in the UK who argued that Jihadi John was subjected to a type of harassment by the British security services that proved to be a causal factor in his radicalization process. In one interview, the lobby group, Cage Prisoners, insisted in response to a question about responsibility for the beheadings in Syria: \"The man who cut off their heads, and if you take that back a step, the people who potentially helped in his radicalization; in this case, the security services.\" Specialists in the field of radicalization took great exception to the implication, with experts from the likes of Exeter University and Kings College London describing it as \"absurd,\" and \"bizarre.\" Certainly, there are questions to be raised with regards to the British security services -- including how Jihadi John, who was known to them, was allowed to leave the country, as well as how suspects are interrogated and questioned. There shouldn't be any sensitivity about this -- the British security services do the job that they do precisely so Britons live in a society open enough to be able to ask these questions without fear or reprisal. Nevertheless, the suggestion that the British security services somehow radicalized Jihadi John is peculiar. There are many high-profile members of ISIS in Syria and Iraq who underwent no harassment of any sort -- for example, Lotfi Arrifin, a youth leader in a Malaysian political party. There are also many who have undergone far more invasive encounters with other security establishments worldwide, at the hands of authoritarian governments in the Arab world and elsewhere -- they did not suddenly register for service in the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa. Does it make them more vulnerable to possible recruitment? It very well could -- but that's not a foregone conclusion. Otherwise, given the scale of autocratic oppression in recent history, we should have seen far more members of ISIS. There will be those who contend radical Islamist theology is all we need to look at in understanding radicalization -- there will be others who will place all attention on domestic issues such as the security services, or foreign policy. The reality is, however, there is no template for explaining the voyage an individual takes in becoming a member of ISIS or any other radical Islamist group. For different individuals, different factors make them vulnerable to recruitment. More often than not, a recruit will find him or herself looking for some kind of \"meaning\" in this world -- and repugnant though ISIS ideology may be, it does provide a sense of certainty. What makes recruits more attuned to that kind of absolutism as opposed to going down other paths? It may be many things that condition them before they accept radical Islamism as their \"savior.\" In all cases, nevertheless, there are two things we ought to keep foremost in mind. We must understand the context of the paths these recruits go through, to avoid others doing the same -- and we must always keep in mind that regardless of the context, only one person has responsibility for their actions. Each one of them, themselves.",

        "document": "A six-year-old boy was buried today in St. Louis after he was killed last week in an gun attack his parents say stemmed from a traffic dispute. Marcus Johnson Jr visited O'Fallon Park with his parents, four siblings, and other friends and family members while recovering from heart surgery one week earlier. He had a post-operation appointment the day he was killed. Police are searching for the occupants of a car who shot at the family's minivan as they left the north St Louis park in a minivan at about 7.30pm on March 11. Marcus Johnson Jr.'s parents figured a day at a city park was just what the 6-year-old kindergartner needed while recovering from heart surgery the previous week. Instead, his family buried Marcus today after the child was shot in the chest and killed in an attack his mother and father said stemmed from a traffic dispute . Marcus Johnson Sr. said he returned fire in self-defense as the rolling shootout continued for several blocks. Marcus's 15-year-old brother and a 69-year-old family friend were also wounded. 'My baby already had stress to live in this world, and for somebody to take his life away is wrong,' mother Quiana Johnson told the St Louis Post Dispatch. She said that Marcus, who was in kindergarten, had suffered from a heart ailment since birth. His family had to watch him closely because he was taking blood-thinning drugs so he had to be careful not to get bruised. 'He was a happy, happy, loving and caring kid,' she told the St Louis Post Dispatch. 'Through his sickness he was happy.' The day of the shooting, the family had piled into their recently purchased 2006 Pontiac Montana and headed to the park. Quiana Johnson said it 'was a nice day' and that it gave them a chance to 'get out of the house and do some things as a family'. She said that as they were leaving, her husband saw someone he knew and stopped his vehicle to chat, annoying another man who was stuck because of the traffic. Quiana Johnson said the man told them it was his 'hood' and that the family shouldn't hold up traffic. Marcus suffered from a heart ailment and had surgery the week before he was shot. He had been at a post-operation appointment prior to going to the park. His mother said he was taking blood-thinning drugs and had to be careful not to get bruised . The family returned to the car and as they drove to the exit of the park, the man followed them and began shooting. Quiana Johnson had a gun on her - which she had recently bought because of a fear of break-ins in her neighborhood - and when she noticed her son had been shot, she handed it to her husband. 'I told him that if he didn't shoot back, they will kill us all,' she told the St Louis Post Dispatch. She crawled to the back of the van, where her son had been shot and the rest of her family members were huddling. 'I said, \"little Marcus, wake up. Don't go to sleep. Mommy is right here with you. Wake up.\" He was trying,' she said. Once they escaped the shooting they called the police who took Marcus to Barnes-Jewish Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Funeral arrangements were taken care of at Ronald L Jones Funeral Chapel in St Louis. Johnson said Marcus, his youngest son, was diagnosed with a heart ailment as an infant.",

        "document": "Jonny Evans' actions in spitting at Papiss Cisse were 'simply disgusting', a Football Association regulatory commission ruled. The written reasons for Evans' six-match ban were released by the FA on Thursday. The Manchester United defender and Newcastle striker Cisse were both charged after spitting at each other during the Red Devils' 1-0 victory on March 4 in an incident missed by referee Anthony Taylor. Newcastle's Papiss Cisse and Manchester United's Jonny Evans squared at St James' Park last week . Cisse has been banned for seven games, while Evans has received a six game suspension . Cisse accepted the charge and a seven-match ban - one extra because of a previous offence this season - but Evans insisted he had not intended to spit at the striker and contested it. The three members of the regulatory commission accepted 27-year-old Evans was the only person who could know his intent, but stated: 'It is clear that Mr Evans is looking directly and indeed aggressively at Mr Cisse. His lips are 'pursed' and he is close to Mr Cisse. 'If he was, as alleged to be the case, a person who 'habitually spits', then the commission were concerned as to why he did not turn his head away from Mr Cisse when so spitting. 'If that had been a family member or indeed another team member or his manager in front and below him would he still have carried out the same manoeuvre? Evans' actions have been described as 'simply disgusting' by the FA's regulatory committee . Both Evans and Cisse were charged and banned by the FA for spitting, but Cisse admitted the offence . 'Mr Evans had (and has) a duty of care, if spitting for whatever reason, not to direct the same in the general direction of an opponent, or indeed anyone else. The video clips clearly show that he failed in his duty of care. 'There may, in some quarters, be substantial sympathy for Mr Evans, but the video evidence shows that he did what he did, and the ordinary man in the street will find his action to be simply disgusting and should not be allowed in any walk of life, let alone on any football field.' The written report also reveals Manchester United questioned the length of the suspension but the commission did not consider there were any 'truly exceptional' circumstances to reduce it from the standard six matches.",

        "document": "Jihadi John dumped two schoolboys on the M1 motorway at gunpoint in revenge for an attack on his brother, it was revealed today. Mohammed Emwazi - unmasked as the killer in the infamous ISIS beheading videos last week - carried out the kidnap during his days living on a notorious housing estate. He and two bearded associates are said to have abducted two gang members accused of beating up his younger brother, Omar, in 2008. Mohammed Emwazi (left) - now unmasked as ISIS killer Jihadi John - reportedly kidnapped two schoolboys and threatened them with a gun after his younger brother Omar (right) was attacked  in 2008 . The brothers were living on the Mozart estate in west London at the time of the incident, which was known for its postcode gang 'the Mozart Bloods'. A former friend of Omar told the Evening Standard today that he went to buy a stolen bike from Emwazi's younger brother in 2008, a time when the now notorious terrorist was still studying at Westminster University. The friend, who was 14 at the time, said he and Omar were then attacked by two teenage members of the 'Bloods', who broke his arm because he was from a different postcode and punched Omar in the face. When Emwazi found out about the incident, he sought revenge on the two schoolboys who had carried out the beating, the source said. He told the London paper: 'They drove round in a car and found these two guys who attacked us, threatened them with a gun, made them take all their clothes off and drove off. 'They dumped them on the M1 motorway. They weren't attacked physically but they were threatened. It was a message.' A former friend of Omar Emwazi say boys who assaulted him and Omar were dumped on the M1 motorway without their clothes in revenge for the violent attack (file picture) Details of Emwazi's links to criminals have emerged since he was unmasked as the ISIS killer last week . The source said Emwazi was not a known gang member at the time but was 'a bit of a hard nut'. Since Emwazi was unmasked as Jihadi John last week,  his links to criminals during his time growing up in London have been exposed. He was known to associate with Choukri Ellekhlifi \u2013 a member of a gang which preyed on rich targets in a series of violent attacks and who also later travelled to Syria to join ISIS. The Moroccan-born criminal was thought to have been two years below Emwazi at Quintin Kynaston academy in St John's Wood, North West London, which Omar also attended. It was also revealed last week that Emwazi stood trial twice, accused of having stolen bikes hidden in the family shed and was twiceacquitted. The first case only came to court after the owner of one of the stolen bikes tracked down Emwazi, who had put it up for sale on Ebay. The victim contacted him posing as a prospective buyer to get his details which he then passed on to the police. Emwazi faced five charges of possession of criminal property on or before September 29 2010, 'knowing or suspecting it to represent the proceeds of criminal property.' Emwazi's former home (pictured) was on the Mozart estate in west London known for its postcode gang . Emwazi, who was 22 at the time, claimed he had bought the bikes from the GumTree website and was selling them on at a profit. The judge directed the jury to find Emwazi not guilty after a two day trial at Snaresbrook Crown Court in June 2011. Emwazi faced a second trial at Southwark Crown Court a few months later in December 2011 for a similar case where he was also acquitted. Omar, five years his junior, pleaded guilty to possession of stolen goods - bikes - at Isleworth Crown Court in West London in August 2012. Emwazi family in England are now in hiding while father in living in his native Kuwait, from where he has questioned whether his son Mohammed is the killer in the Jihadi John films. It was reported today that Emwazi - who was known to the security services after being accused of trying to get into Somalia - slipped out of Britain by hiding in the back of a lorry before crossing Europe to get to Syria. The BBC has defended its coverage of the unmasking of Jihadi John as Mohammed Emwazi after viewers accused them of glamorising his cause. Emwazi was named last week and details about his family life and education in west London were uncovered by journalists. On the day his identity emerged, the BBC broadcast live from a press conference by prisoner's rights group Cage for 52 minutes. At the press conference, the group's leader Asim Qureshi called the masked killer 'a beautiful young man' and blamed security services for his actions. A BBC journalist gives a live update from outside the home of Mohammed Emwazi last week. The corporation has defended itself against claims it 'glamorised' the ISIS killer . The BBC said it had received 'some complaints from viewers and listeners who feel there has been too much coverage' of the story. But a corporation spokesman said the story was 'globally significant' and the identification of Emwazi was 'an important development'. He said: 'We have a responsibility to report the story as well as examine Emwazi's background and shed light on his radicalisation. We don't believe that our coverage has glamorised him or Islamic State. 'We have made it very clear that he appears to be responsible for a number of brutal killings, and is a member of a growing, well-armed, well-financed organisation that commits acts of brutality and is having a profound impact on the security of the Middle East. 'We feel BBC News has reported on the activities of Islamic State and Mohammed Emwazi in a clear and accurate manner.' The BBC, along with Sky News, broadcast live from a press conference given by 'human rights' group Cage, whose director Asim Qureshi (left) said Emwazi was a 'beautiful young man'",

The Hibernian boss was astonished that Collum didn\u2019t award a free-kick after Lee Wallace appeared to foul Paul Hanlon as the centre-half sought to clear. Kenny Miller seized the loose ball and, with the home defence still appealing for an infringement, cracked home an 80th-minute shot that added to Wallace\u2019s opener. Hibernian manager Alan Stubbs speaks to the fourth official; he was unhappy with the referee's performance . Referee Willie Collum was on the end of some stick from Hibs boss Stubbs after their game against Rangers . Stubbs attempted to pick his words carefully afterwards but couldn\u2019t disguise his anger towards Collum, who has been at the centre of numerous controversies this season. \u2018Can I say no comment in case I get into any trouble?\u2019 Stubbs opened. \u2018I\u2019ve been in management a short time. I was a player a long time. Over the years, that decision would be given 100 per cent of the time. \u2018I think that\u2019s probably the best way to describe it without me getting into trouble. \u2018Not 90 per cent, not 99 per cent, 100 per cent. But a guy who has an influence over a game decided differently. Stubbs was sure that a foul on Paul Hanlon (right) would have been given '100 per cent' of the time . Stubbs (centre) watches on from the dugout as his Hibs side fell to a 2-0 defeat by Rangers . \u2018When he sees it back again... well, there\u2019s no point. He\u2019s there to get the big calls right and he got a big call very, very wrong. \u2018There was no point speaking to him afterwards. Everyone in the stadium could see it was a foul. \u2018I don\u2019t want to sit here and try to justify a decision. Only one guy can do that, but he\u2019s protected and not allowed to talk. It spoiled the game, although obviously not from Rangers\u2019 point of view.\u2019 Hanlon was booked for his protests towards Collum as Rangers celebrated Miller\u2019 s first goal since December. \u2018Most of the stadium felt it was a foul,\u2019 said the defender. \u2018I thought it was but the referee thought differently. Kenny Miller (centre) celebrates after his goal gave Rangers an unassailable 2-0 lead over Hibs . Miller is mobbed by the ecstatic Rangers supporters who had made the trip to Easter Road on Saturday . \u2018I read the pass, got in front of Wallace and went to clear with my right foot. I just felt like I was taken out. \u2018It\u2019s disappointing a decision like that has maybe ruined our chances of getting anything from the game. \u2018I wasn\u2019t given an explanation, he (Collum) just decided to book me for dissent even though I didn\u2019t say much. \u2018I just said it was a foul, along with everyone else who surrounded him. \u2018I didn\u2019t even think I was in his face but I think he just has to pick a player and book him.\u2019",

The idea of Black Friday has been imported from America, where retailers offer big discounts to kick start the Christmas shopping season. However, it proved a disaster in Britain last year with long queues and violent scenes which saw the police criticising supermarkets for failing to put in place proper security. The web stores trade body, IMRG, has warned retailers that they will have to fundamentally rethink how they handle Black Friday this year after a catastrophe in 2014 . At the same time, many online stores were simply unable to cope with the rush of orders with the result that a huge delivery backlog was created. Many retailers were also disappointed to find the event merely brought forward sales that would have happened later in December, rather than generating any extra business. The web stores trade body, IMRG, has warned retailers that they will have to fundamentally rethink how they handle Black Friday this year. Significantly, it said: \u2018Black Friday can be very profitable for retailers who get it right, but discount rates will need to be rationalised and panic-discounting avoided.\u2019 It suggests stores might want to spread the discounts and promotion over a longer period, perhaps a weekend or week, in order to avoid the spike in orders. Firms should also ensure they have sufficient couriers to cope and warn customers that deliveries may take longer than normal, or set up alternative click and collect services. Scenes of violence: Cutomers fought tooth and nail to make the most of discount deals on black Friday.\u00a0The scale of the event greatly exceeded everyone\u2019s expectations .

Some retailers were disappointed to find the event merely brought forward sales that would have happened later in December, rather than generating any extra business . The IMRG said: \u2018The scale of Black Friday 2014 greatly exceeded everyone\u2019s expectations, which meant a large number of online orders were compressed into a far shorter period of time than anticipated \u2013 triggering an online retail \u2018delivery tsunami\u2019. \u2018This heavily impacted carrier and retailer fulfilment operations and normal activity suffered for days afterwards.\u2019 Andrew Starkey, head of e-logistics at IMRG, said: \u2018The huge surge in demand on Black Friday 2014 was unprecedented and caught everyone in the industry by surprise. Fevered and bullish behaviour in retail outlets saw the police criticising supermarkets for failing to put in place proper security . \u2018The exact form of it may evolve in 2015, but at least this time we have a precedent and time to develop strategies to ensure the Christmas peak runs as efficiently as possible. \u2018It\u2019s fair to say that Black Friday splits opinion, but the impact of it is so vast that it affects all retailers whether they run campaigns or not. \u2018The key points for industry to address are around how to smooth out the spike \u2013 even spreading it over a few days would make a massive difference to fulfilment operations \u2013 and managing expectation so that customers receive accurate and up-to-date information about the progress of their orders.\u2019 Firms should also ensure they have sufficient couriers to cope and warn customers that deliveries may take longer than normal, or set up alternative click and collect services, the\u00a0IMRG said.",

Hamilton's world championship defence got off to a flying start on Sunday with a crushing victory for Mercedes in the season-opening Melbourne race as F1 rivals succumbed to a farcical rash of reliability problems. Pole-sitter Hamilton started from a grid reduced to 15 cars from a possible 20 and cruised to his 34th race win with a 1.3sec gap to runner-up team-mate Nico Rosberg. Lewis Hamilton celebrates his Australian GP win in front of second-placed Nico Rosberg and Sebastian Vettel . Hamilton stormed to victory at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix following a dominant performance . Nico Rosberg followed Hamilton home as Mercedes picked up where they left off with total domination . By the time fans were heading out of Albert Park, Red Bull consultant Helmut Marko was discussing the possibility of billionaire owner Dietrich Mateschitz falling out of love with the sport and leaving. Appearing on an afternoon TV show in Sydney on Tuesday, Hamilton agreed that Mercedes' dominance had caused controversy and responded to suggestions of a possible Red Bull withdrawal by saying all the other teams could do better. 'It's very interesting to hear that when they dominated for four years, big time. They've not had a good couple of years - they didn't do so bad last year. Hamilton and Rosberg (right) shake hands  after Mercedes pair finished more than 30 seconds ahead of third . Helmut Marko (left, with former Red Bull driver Sebastian Vettel) says the team will evaluate the situation . 'But you've seen a real big improvement from Ferrari, they've actually overtaken Red Bull and Williams have made a really big step and I think you're going to have to watch them really closely this year. 'There's a lot of potential, particularly in the rules for them to make big steps and close the gap. So we still have a fight on our hands,' said Hamilton. There have been suggestions that F1 is too technical and complicated. but Hamilton did not agree. 'It's not for us...So you've got to hire some better people I guess. Ultimately it's a test and a challenge of evolution, of innovation and we've hired great people to - and we've done a great job and we weren't complaining when they were doing.' Red Bull chief Christian Horner is concerned that Mercedes dominance will be unhealthy for the sport . Horner's Red Bull team won consecutive titles between\u00a02010-2013 with Sebastian Vettel behind the wheel . Asked if criticism was just 'sour grapes', the British champion said: 'I'm not going to get into the political side of things, I just drive. I'm really grateful for, for what Mercedes have done as a team. 'There's over 1,000 people in our team who've done an amazing job, and the car's fantastic - best car I've ever driven, so happy with it and I want to really grab the opportunity with both hands and do the best job I can.' Asked if Mercedes' domination of Sunday's race was boring, Hamilton replied: 'Definitely wasn't for me!'",

Built around a single hexagonal table it seats just six diners, who all sit across from each other on wooden benches that are covered in reindeer hide.

'When I first looked into building my studio, my builders and I believed that planning permission was not necessary,' she said. 'It was only at the end of the year that someone from Gloucester City Council contacted me. 'I immediately invited him to visit and he is satisfied about the business activity but he felt that contrary to my research, planning permission was needed.

        "document": "A man from the NSW Hunter region who killed a litter of puppies by smashing them over the head with a rock has been slapped with an extra nine animal cruelty charges. It comes amidst news that the sole pup to survive the attack, nicknamed 'Lucky', is 'stable'. Earlier this month an advertisement was posted on website Gumtree selling a litter of bull terrier puppies. When the 11 pups failed to sell in a week, the seller offered them for free, police said at the time. Scroll down for video . The only pup to have survived the attack on\u00a0a litter of bull terriers near New Castle last month -nicknamed 'Lucky' is doing well in RSPCA care . Police allege Nathan Thompson, 25, collected the animals on March 11 and took them to bushland at Kurri Kurri, near Newcastle. It's alleged that a witness saw the 25-year-old man begin to kill a number of the puppies, aged six to eight weeks, by hitting them over the head with a rock before throwing them into the bush. The witness confronted the man, who drove away from the area. An RSPCA inspector was called to the bushland and found five dead pups and another two still clinging to life. Nathan Thompson (pictured) pleaded guilty to nine extra animal cruelty charges in court on Thursday . 'There were seven pups in total when we arrived and five of them were deceased,' David O'Shannessy, RSPCA NSW's chief inspector, told Daily Mail Australia. 'Most of them had significant head injuries so you can image what the scene was like when we got there. 'The inspectors quickly transported the surviving dogs to the clinic but one of them died on the way.' The only pup to survive the ordeal has since been named 'Lucky' and is being cared for by the RSPCA, who last week confirmed she was doing well. 'There are rumours flying around about Lucky, the sole survivor of the horrible animal cruelty case in Kurri Kurri last week, that she isn't doing well. We are happy to quell these rumours and let you know that she is still stable and under close veterinary surveillance,' the RSPCA wrote on their Facebook page. He allegedly loaded 11 Bull Terriers in his car and took them to bushland at McLeods Road, Kurri Kurri - north of Sydney - on Wednesday afternoon.\u00a0Only one of the animals survived (pictured) 'Her condition has not deteriorated. If her condition does change, we will let the community know.' Thompson fronted court earlier this month and pleaded guilty to three animal cruelty charges and resisting arrest. On Thursday he pleaded guilty to another nine animal cruelty offences. He was granted bail on the condition he not have custody of any animals or even be around another animal without an adult present, for a decade. Thompson will be sentenced at Newcastle Local Court in May. Thompson was granted bail on the condition he not have custody of any animals. He\u00a0will be sentenced at Newcastle Local Court in May . According to the\u00a0Sydney Morning Herald, Thompson made comments at his home after being released on bail following his first charges, saying he knew he looked 'cold blooded' but he believed he was helping out a friend. 'People are looking at me like I'm a cold-blooded killer because of what I have done and I can understand that,' he said. He added that he 'loved his dog' and was shattered that she was confiscated.

        "document": "(CNN)Is Philae still alive? The answer to this particular cosmic cliff-hanger was left unresolved towards the end of last year. The tiny space probe bounced across the surface of Comet 67P before touching down away from its intended landing zone. It returned plenty of data from the surface but ended up in a shady spot where there wasn't enough sunlight to keep it powered -- so then it went to sleep and nothing has been heard since November. In the months since, mission scientists have not been able to pinpoint its exact resting place. But now the comet-chasing mother ship Rosetta -- in orbit around 67P -- is to begin listening for signs that the lander has survived the cold and dark. Scientists at the European Space Agency (ESA), which is leading a consortium that includes NASA to find out more about the composition of comets and how they interact with the Sun, believe that if enough sunlight falls on Philae's solar panels it could revive. As the comet gets closer to the Sun and more light illuminates the lander, the chances improve. Lander system engineer Laurence O'Rourke told CNN that Philae needs 5.5 watts of power to reboot itself, nine watts to switch on the receiver to accept communications and 19 watts to activate its transmitter and allow two-way communication with the orbiter. Modern energy-saving domestic light bulbs consume 20 watts or lower so it doesn't need much to re-establish contact. On Tuesday, @ESA_Rosetta tweeted: \"Excited! I have some opportunities to listen for @philae2014 to find out if he's awake!\" Rosetta and Philae's love affair on Twitter . On the Rosetta mission blog, lander project manager Stephan Ulamec says: \"It will probably still be too cold for the lander to wake up, but it is worth trying. The prospects will improve with each passing day.\" The mission website adds that Philae could already have woken up but does not yet have sufficient power to communicate with Rosetta. It says Rosetta will transmit to Philae between March 12 and March 20, listening for a response. Problems began for the lander when devices designed to anchor Philae to the surface failed. The gravity is so weak that without the harpoons intended to fire from the feet, the probe bounced across the comet. However, the mishap could prove to be a happy accident. O'Rourke explained that as the comet nears the Sun, Philae's original landing spot would have exposed it to temperatures that would have burned out its electronics. In that position it most likely would have died by now. From lander pictures, mission controllers think Philae, which is about the size of a washing machine, is tucked up underneath a cliff face, affording it some shade. Beginning Thursday, mission controllers will send what O'Rourke described as \"blind commands\" to Philae in the hope that the lander has enough power to receive instructions even if it can't respond. Philae will be told to save power for the transmitter. O'Rourke admits that it's a \"long shot\" but the team will try again in April if this attempt fails. If Philae revives it could be witness to an amazing show as the comet makes its closest approach to the Sun in August. \"I think we are going to see some amazing images at that point,\" said O'Rourke. Even if Philae never wakes up, all is not lost. The mission has detected organic chemicals on the comet surface, though full details of that discovery have yet to be revealed. And the Rosetta mission is already changing perceptions of comets. O'Rourke says instead of a comet being a dirty snowball he now thinks of it as being \"an icy dirtball.\" He described discoveries of dust and large \"boulders\" circling the comet after they were blown off by the Sun during previous orbits, and an image that appears to show a structure the size of a football pitch that has been lifted and then deposited next to the hole. \"The Rosetta mission is not just about the lander. It's about orbiting and following a comet -- watching it wake up and then go to sleep again, finding the secrets held by comets. Every day is a new discovery,\" he said. Scientists have already applauded the mission's success to date. \"The Rosetta radar experiment will reveal for the first time how a comet is put together,\" cosmochemist Denton S. Ebel told CNN in November. CNN Interactive: Rosetta and its mission . Opinion: How comet mission helps search for alien life .",

        "document": "A 15-year-old boy has been arrested by police officers investigating a racist tweet aimed at Arsenal striker Danny Welbeck. The teenager was held and questioned on suspicion of racial abuse following the posting of a sickening message on Twitter after Welbeck scored the winner to knock his former club Manchester United out of the FA Cup on March 9. Officers from Greater Manchester Police launched a probe after a fellow user of the social media site registered a complaint. Danny Welbeck celebrates after scoring against his former club Manchester United last Monday . Welbeck netted the winning goal as Arsenal progressed to the FA Cup semi-finals with a 2-1 victory . Louis van Gaal decided to sell Welbeck after deeming him surplus to requirements at Old Trafford . The vile, racist rant, tweeted by user @angeIsleftfoot, read: 'Welbeck is dead to me, the f****** c***\u2026\u2019 The tweet, posted after Welbeck's decisive role in Arsenal's 2-1 Quarter Final victory at Old Trafford, continued with sickening references that are  too offensive to publish here. Sportsmail understands officers in Manchester with specialist training in social media identified the user and passed on the information to Wiltshire Police, who confirmed they have now made an arrest. A spokesman for Wiltshere Police said: 'A 15-year-old male from the Salisbury area was arrested on the evening of March 12 on suspicion of racial abuse. 'He has been released on police bail until April 13. Welbeck was jeered by a minority of United fans after being replaced by Olivier Giroud late in the game . The 24-year-old shakes hands with former team-mate Wayne Rooney (left) after the game . 'He has been bailed to return to Melksham Police station then.' The vitriolic slur was one of a number of disturbing messages posted in the aftermath of Welbeck's triumphant return to United.

        "document": "Andy Cole has revealed how he was made to feel 'small' by a perceived snub from Teddy Sheringham that led to the England pair not talking. The former Manchester United striker played alongside Sheringham at Old Trafford for four years but did not enjoy a relationship with his compatriot following an incident on international duty. Cole made his England debut from the bench in a 0-0 friendly draw with Uruguay in 1995 and, in replacing then-Tottenham forward Sheringham, felt the lack of acknowledgement from his future United team-mate was disrespectful. Andy Cole (right) played alongside Teddy Sheringham at Manchester United for four years - but the pair never got on following a perceived snub from Sheringham during an England international in 1995 . Sheringham - and David Beckham - congratulate Cole after scoring in a 6-0 win over Bradford City in 2000 . 'From my England debut against Uruguay, he was going to be substituted for me to come on to replace him, and he snubbed me on the line,' Cole said. 'I just thought to myself, 'I'm making my debut here and Wembley is a packed house'. And I felt so small. 'I don't think his apology would come, because I honestly do believe that he believes he was not in the wrong.' Despite a fantastic goalscoring record at club level, Cole only made 15 international appearances and scored just once - famously calling former England boss Glenn Hoddle a 'coward' for announcing he was dropping Cole through the press. 'I don't think it was damaging to my career,' Cole said of his remarks. 'I just think a lot of the media and a lot of Joe Public picked up on that and ran with it and ran with it, and exhausted it. And I remember when it came out, I mean of course it was going to be massive news. He was the England manager.' Cole and Sheringham celebrate on the pitch in 2000 but the didn't speak off it . The pair come face-to-face when Cole played for Manchester City and Sheringham at West Ham in 2005 . Despite a prolific goalscoring record at club level, Cole won just 15 caps for England . Kevin Keegan and Cole, pictured here on international duty, fell out briefly in October 1993 . Cole also had a high-profile falling out with Kevin Keegan in 1993 while at Newcastle, something the striker said was a consequence of tiredness more than anything else. 'I felt so tired, and I couldn't get myself going,' Cole told ITV, 'He [Keegan] said, 'Don't you fancy it today?' So I said to him, 'No I don't fancy it today.' So he said, 'Well if you don't fancy it you can do one.' So I said, 'Okay, not a problem to me,' and I just walked off. 'I got in a taxi and my girlfriend then, she was at home so I just ended up going to hers. And I remember I rang the doorbell and she said to me, 'What are you doing here, you've got a game tonight haven't you?' 'I said I just walked out of there, I couldn't be bothered.' Keegan added: 'We went to play the game, no Andy Cole and we lost, and we go in Friday for training, we've got a game on Saturday. Andy poked his head round [the door] and he just said, \"Gaffer, what do I do now?\" I said, \"I'll tell you what to do, you go out, you train properly and if I think you are fit enough I will put you in the team tomorrow.\"' Andy Cole: Sports Life Stories - ITV4 10pm on\u00a0Tuesday March 10)",

        "document": "David Cameron last night agreed to a single TV debate during the election campaign. The Prime Minister is expected to attend a seven-way session at the start of April, to be shown on ITV. The deal includes three other political programmes during the campaign in which some of the party leaders will take questions from the public or television interviewers. Scroll down for video . The Prime Minister has agreed to one seven-way debate hosted by ITV on April 2. He will also appear on a number of election specials \u2013 but without going head to head against Ed Miliband . Crucially, the BBC, Sky, ITV and Channel 4 appear to have blinked first and dropped their demand for a head-to-head clash between the PM and Ed Miliband. And they have backed down from their apparent threat to \u2018empty chair\u2019 the PM by holding debates with other leaders which he refused to attend. Labour appeared to deny the validity of the new proposal, insisting it still wanted three debates as originally proposed and accusing the PM of \u2018running scared\u2019 of a one-to-one with Mr Miliband. But, in an attempt to nail down the latest agreement, Mr Cameron said the other parties should accept it. \u2018An offer\u2019s been made, a deal\u2019s been accepted, now the other parties must make clear that they accept this deal too, otherwise they will have to bear the responsibility,\u2019 he said. \u2018That\u2019s what happened: a new offer put forward by the broadcasters, led by the BBC, to me, I accepted it, in full, on Saturday. So, I\u2019m helping to make this debate go ahead. The other parties have got to stop running away from this and agree to the debate the broadcasters have now suggested.\u2019 Labour leader Ed Miliband and the Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg would only face Mr Cameron in one seven-way debate . The latest proposal is thought to have been presented to the parties over the weekend. According to Tory sources, it includes four potential shows, the first in just nine days\u2019 time on March 26. It will be a Channel 4 and Sky joint production hosted by Jeremy Paxman and featuring the PM and Mr Miliband, one after the other, facing questions from the host and a studio audience. The second show will be the only debate and will involve seven party leaders, with the addition of Nick Clegg, Nigel Farage, Green leader Natalie Bennett, Nicola Sturgeon of the SNP and the Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood. It will be broadcast by ITV on April 2. On April 16 the BBC is proposing a \u2018challengers\u2019 debate featuring the Greens, SNP, Ukip and Plaid. A week before polling day, on April 30, the BBC will host a 90-minute Question Time-style show with Mr Cameron, Mr Miliband and Mr Clegg appearing one after the other to face questions from a TV audience. This is a better deal for the Lib Dems, who complained that a head-to-head between the other two leaders would prevent them from defending their record in government. A Labour spokesman said: \u2018No one should be fooled: David Cameron is still running scared of a head-to-head televised debate with Ed Miliband.\u2019 n Mr Cameron poked fun at Ed Miliband for posing for TV cameras in a pokey kitchen that turned out to be one of two in his \u00a32.5million London home. \u2018I am not saying this to make a point but you shouldn\u2019t pretend to be something you are not,\u2019 the Prime Minister said. Showing off the open-plan kitchen he and wife Samantha had installed in Downing Street, he added: \u2018We are lucky, we both work, we were able to spend our own money on this. \u2018To me, the kitchen is where you spend all your time. It needs a sofa you can slump on, a table you can sit at, a kitchen you can cook in, a place children can do their homework.\u2019 Under the broadcasters' latest proposal, the Tory, Lib Dem and Labour leaders would appear on Question Time hosted by David Dimbleby (left). David Cameron and Ed Miliband would be interviewed one after the other in a Channel 4/Sky special hosted by Jeremy Paxman (right)",

        "document": "An eight-year-old schoolboy who dressed as a character from Fifty Shades of Grey for World Book Day was laughed at by teachers, while a second school child was told he couldn't take part for wearing the same costume. Cole Froom pulled on one of his father's suits and arrived at Lakes Primary School in Redcar and Cleveland, North Yorkshire, dressed as Christian Grey - where staff found his costume 'funny'. However, in Manchester, Liam Scholes was 'excluded' from lessons after teachers at Sale High School branded his outfit, inspired by actor Jamie Dornan, was inappropriate.\u00a0The 11-year-old pupil was dressed in a shiny grey suit, equipped with cable ties and a face mask. Scroll down for video . Cole Froom, eight, (left) in his version of character Christian Grey from Fifty Shades of Grey. Jamie Dornan, (right), played the character in the recent blockbuster hit . But Cole's 28-year-old mother, Joanne Dickinson, was surprised when she heard Liam Scholes had been disciplined for the outfit, after her son's teacher reacted by laughing. She said: 'I took him into the classroom and his teacher asked who he was and he said Christian Grey and the teacher just started laughing. 'Some of the kids had never heard of him so not many knew who he was dressed as but those who did thought it was funny'. Miss Dickinson, who has an older daughter, Caitlyn, 10, and a 12-month-old baby called Harrison, said the Year 4 pupil came up with the outfit idea himself. 'He was asking on Wednesday about what he could go as for World Book Day. I'd done some researching and couldn't come up with anything. 'Then he suggested going as Christian Grey himself. He'd seen that I had the book and heard me go on about seeing the film. 'He hasn't read the book or seen the film but there are adverts on in the day and he's asked about it. But he thinks it's about a rich man that owns a big house and a helicopter.' Cole (left) pictured with his mother, Joanne Dickinson (centre), sister Caitlyn, 10, (right) and 12-month-old baby brother Harrison (in Miss Dickinson's arms) Cole asked his father, Stuart Froom, who is separated from Miss Dickinson, if he could borrow one of his suits. After some persuasion the 35-year-old carer allowed him to wear his black shirt, grey tie and grey trousers. 'His dad popped in between his work hours with the outfit, but did say he didn't think it was a good idea, but we went ahead with it anyway. 'Most of the parents at the school thought it was funny. One or two have made little digs saying he shouldn't know what that is - but he doesn't know what it is.' Father Stuart Froom (centre) let Cole (right) borrow one of his shirts and ties to go as Christian Grey for World Book Day on Thursday. Sister Caitlyn, who is in Year 6, didn't get to dress up for the event . Caitlin, 10, (left) with Cole (right) and their baby brother Harrison (centre). When Cole arrived at school his teacher, dressed as Harry Potter, found the outfit funny . The full-time mother said she 'couldn't understand' why staff at Sale High School had taken such drastic action over the costume. She said: 'I thought it went a bit far. I was half-expecting one of my son's teachers to pull me up on it today but they didn't.' Children around the country were encouraged to go to school dressed as literary characters on Thursday as part of the global event. The Fifty Shades Of Grey novels by E L James series have sold more than 100million copies and tell the story of the relationship between a college student and a wealthy businessman. They are notorious for their explicit scenes featuring sex acts and bondage, which some campaigners claim promotes domestic abuse. Liam Scholes (pictured) was told off by teachers after turning up to school dressed as Christian Grey - complete with cable ties and a sleeping mask . Liam, pictured, was told he couldn't appear in his class photo wearing the outfit from the controversial movie . Cole's experience was completely different to Liam Scholes from Sale High School in Manchester who also arrived in class dressed as Christian Grey from the novel. Teachers objected when the youngster appeared with cable ties and an eye mask which were both props from the controversial book. Staff then rang Liam's mother Nicola, who herself is a primary school teacher, to tell her that the outfit was inappropriate. She said: 'We thought it was funny. We were walking home from school and he had the idea of going as Christian Grey. 'At first we laughed it off but the we discussed it with a few friends and saw the funny side and decided it was quite a good costume idea. 'He went in a suit and shoes and with an eye mask and cable ties. The cable ties were tiny and not enough to do anything with them. We didn't think there would be a problem. 'I got a phone call home from the school saying the outfit was inappropriate and that he had been excluded from taking part or being in any of the photographs.' Among the more traditional Oliver Twists, Burglar Bills and Where's Wallys, schools around Britain welcomed some more unusual 'literary' characters yesterday. Jamie Peek, from Lowestoft, Suffolk, surprised his friends at Woods Loke primary by turning up as Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson. His mother, Caroline, said: 'He's mad about cars and a massive Top Gear fan so he told me he wanted to go as Jeremy Clarkson.' Jamie Peek from Lowestoft, Suffolk went to World Book Day as Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson . Mrs Peek added: 'It was a bit of a strange costume to pull together but I got a wig from eBay and trimmed it to look right. Most of the clothes are his own. He even impersonated Jeremy Clarkson's grumpy faced Twitter profile picture for the class photo. 'He's got a number of Top Gear annuals and books. I think it's good for his reading.' Parents around the country were divided over whether superheroes more famous for films than books, such as Ironman and Spiderman, count as literary characters. But the biggest debate on Twitter centred around the army of girls dressed up as Princess Elsa and Princess Anna from Disney's Frozen seen turning up at schools. Benjamin Johncock tweeted: 'A little girl is dressed up as Elsa from Frozen. I want to shout at her, THAT\u2019S NOT A BOOK' Hundreds of girls around the UK arrived dressed as Princess Elsa from Frozen, though some parents questioned whether the Disney characters is truly literary . Claire Anderson added: 'My daughter is VERY unimpressed by the 23(!!) girls dressed up in Frozen costumes for #WorldBookDay at school' A website user called saraurora added: 'The boy dressed as an oompa-loompa in a sea of Elsa's and superheroes is my idol' Others insisted Frozen now has plenty of follow-up books based on the film and is an adapted version the classic Snow Queen tale. Atticus Beaterband replied: 'Frozen is a riff on the Snow Queen by Hans Christian Andersen so technically it maybe could sneak in under the bar?'",

Cylvia Hayes' fianc\u00e9 John Kitzhaber was forced to resign as governor in February over allegations that he helped steer business to her environmental consulting firm and then cover up the activity. The couple are now facing federal corruption investigations from both the FBI and IRS - though no charges have been levied. Cylvia Hayes' fianc\u00e9 John Kitzhaber was forced to resign over allegations that he helped steer business to her environmental consulting firm . Hayes compared her own public humiliation with that of Monic Lewinsky, who spoke out about having her life laid bare following revelations of her affair with President Bill Clinton . On Tuesday, Hayes posted a link to a TED Talk by Lewinsky called 'The Price of Shame' in which the infamous former White House intern says criticizes the 'rush to judgement' in the media over revelations of her affair with President Bill Clinton. 'Overnight I went from being a completely private figure to a publicly humiliated one worldwide,' Lewinsky says. Hayes shared the link with the comment: 'I am so appreciative of her for taking this on. 'This is a powerful statement about how our click-for-cash media business model has turned public humiliation into a commodity and shame into an industry.' It was Hayes' first time speaking out since her\u00a0fianc\u00e9's resignation on on February. She also tweeted out a link to an apology written by a Politico reporter who accused two Secret Service agents of crashing into a barricade while drunk outside the White House. The details of that incident remain unclear. This is the latest example of Hayes and Kitzhaber blaming the media for being forced out of the governor's office. When he resigned Kitzhaber, who has just won a fourth term as governor, blasted the press - saying, 'it is deeply troubling to me to realize that we have come to a place in the history of this great state of ours where a person can be charged, tried, convicted and sentenced by the media with no due process and no independent verification of the allegations involved.'",

More than 60 people attended his funeral today including members of the Tall Cub of Great Britain and eight pallbearers were needed to carry him.

Britain's former tallest man Christopher Greener was buried today in a bespoke coffin measuring almost 8ft long and eight pallbearers were needed to carry him . Mr Greener, who grew to be 7ft 6in and a half inches and weighed up to 30 stone, died last month, aged 71 . 'Chris, as my wife would say was a 'gentle giant', he was very funny, caring and kind and our whole family will miss him terribly. 'He struggled towards the end of his life with his health and found it increasingly difficult to get around. 'Mowing the lawn and day-to-day chores were extremely difficult for him being so extremely tall but he was always cheery and never stopped making us laugh. 'He even joked to Irene, my wife, that he expected getting a coffin to fit him could be difficult and that he wouldn't mind if we just got someone to 'break his legs'. 'My wife and I are thankful to Chris for all of the great memories that he has provided us with and we will never forget the gentle giant that we loved dearly.' The coffin (right) was made specifically for him and at least 10 pallbearers were needed to carry it as he also weighed 30 stone . Mr Greener had to be buried in a double plot of land, which is normally reserved for two people . Mr Greener had to be buried in a double plot of land, which is normally reserved for two people, at his parish church in Hayes, near Bromley, Kent. He was diagnosed at 27 with a condition known as pituitary gigantism where a tumour had grown on his pituitary gland, an organ that controls bodily functions including release of growth hormones. Surgeons removed the tumour when he was already in the record books for being UK's tallest man and he would have continued to grow if they had not. He played basketball internationally for Great Britain in the late 60s and early 70s and played the circus giant in David Lynch's film The Elephant Man. Mr Greener also starred in The Rainbow Thief and Birdie Blues as well as appearing in several documentaries chronicling the lives of the very tall. Mr Greener held the title of Britain's tallest man for four decades and is pictured  in 1996 outside the\u00a0Market Weighton house once owned by Yorkshire's 7ft 9ins Giant William Bradley and later by Sylvia France (left) Mr Greener lost his title as Britain's tallest man in 2007. The 71-year-old spent the majority of his life towering over friends and family. He is pictured above at a friend's wedding . Fellow actor and friend Ross Sambridge, 7ft 1in tall, met Christopher at the Tall Club which he founded. Ross said 'He was a great guy, a real gent.' Matthew Uden Funeral Director from W.Uden and Sons said: 'I had the pleasure to find out about Christopher after I had a long chat with his friends, they described him as a gentle giant who had an enormous heart. 'The funeral went very well with some beautiful things being said about his life and antics, I am sure that he would have been pleased with his send off. 'Mr Greener was an extremely tall chap and we had 8 coffin bearers to carry him in to the church as opposed to the usual 4 or 6.' Mr Greener's height afforded him roles in films.

He held the title for 40 years and was replaced in 2007 by Neil Fingleton, who measures 7ft 7.56ins tall. Mr Fingleton, from Durham, also played basketball and is now an actor, having recently starred alongside Mila Kunis in Jupiter Ascending. Neither however beat the record of William Bradley, who at 7ft 9ins tall, was known as the Yorkshire Giant until his death in 1820.

        "document": "More than half of young adults in Los Angeles can fluently speak a language other than English, despite the fact that the city's percentage of foreign born residents is decreasing. Fifty-seven per cent of those aged 18 to 34, in LA spoke a language other than English at home, beating out Miami which had 55 per cent and San Jose with 54 per cent. Roughly a quarter of the 'Millenial' generation nationwide uses another language, according to the American Community Survey. A map of young adults' ability to speak a language other than English uses dark red for counties where more than 40 per cent of 18 to 34-year-olds communicate in a foreign language at home, and lighter shades of pink for smaller proportions of the population . Roughly 60 per cent of LA city residents age five and older speak a language other than English, with Spanish the most popular language among them. In addition to a large number of Latino immigrants, Los Angeles also has large Middle Eastern, Asian, Middle Eastern and Eastern European communities. However, the proportion of foreign-born adults in Los Angeles has actually decreased 9 percentage points to a little less than a third since 1990, and a large number of the Millenials with foreign language skills are thought to be bilingual. The rise in bilingualism is probably caused by children continuing to speak their parents' tongues in addition to English, according to\u00a0Voice of America. UCLA professor Raul Hinojosa said that the children and grandchildren of immigrants historically stopped learning to speak the same language of their ancestors, but that there has been a 'sea change in the last ten years'. California has seen a growing percentage of its young adults speaking foreign languages (bars in blue) since the 1980s. The US as a whole (pink bars) has also seen its rate increase at a slower pace . Hinojosa said that languages beyond Spanish, second and third-generation immigrants will be encouraged to keep knowledge of Mandarin and other languages. The American Community Survey collected data between 2009 and 2013 and found that 23.3 per cent of the population was between 18 and 34 years old, a fall from 30 per cent in 1980. Data showed that the generation is less likely to be married and more likely to have gone to college than three decades ago, as well as more likely to speak a foreign language. Areas that showed the highest rates for speaking something other than English were near the US-Mexico border in California and Texas. New Jersey was found to be the third most likely state for a young adult to speak a foreign language at home. West Virginia ranked last for the statistic with 3.63 per cent and Middlesborough, Kentucky, was the metro with the lowest percentage of young adults who could speak a foreign language with 0.034. In contrast to Los Angeles, many US cities and states have seen significant increases in their foreign-born populations. The United States as a whole saw its estimated foreign-born population decline 0.4 percentage points from 2000 to the American Community Survey. US: 25 per cent . Atlanta: 22.5 . Boston: 28.1 .

        "document": "Nine-man Cardiff survived a late Brentford onslaught to dent the home side's promotion charge with a smash-and-grab 2-1 win. All the goals came from goalkeeping blunders in a game which ended with Kadeem Harris and Federico Macheda both seeing red for Cardiff. Andre Gray gave the home side a first-half lead, but goals from Macheda and Alex Revell turned things round for Cardiff. Cardiff's Kadeem Harris was sent off for a reckless lunge on Brentford midfielder Alan Judge . The Welsh club came to west London with a game plan to stifle the fluent Bees by breaking the game up at every opportunity, and Brentford at times looked rattled by their physical approach. Yet the Bees took the lead midway through the first half after a howler by their former stopper Simon Moore, who could only parry Alex Pritchard's dipping free-kick into the path of Gray to bundle home from close range. The hosts should have put the game beyond doubt by the break, only an acrobatic Moore save denying Pritchard's deflected looping shot. Jota also caused havoc down the right flank and Gray twice went close to extending the lead before the break. Brentford striker Andre Gray beats Cardiff goalkeeper Simon Moore (left) to score opening goal . However, the Bluebirds upped the physical stakes after the interval and made Brentford pay for a lacklustre display. Macheda drew them level on 53 minutes when Brentford goalkeeper David Button collided with his own centre-back Harlee Dean and dropped the ball into the path of the Italian, who slid home from 12 yards. And the comeback was complete on 68 minutes when Button raced off his line to intercept a hopeful through ball and was caught in no man's land for Revell to chip home into the empty goal. However, the sheen was taken off the win by two red cards for the Welshmen. Alex Revell (left) celebrates scoring Cardiff's winner with Federico Macheda . Harris, on loan at Griffin Park last season, was the first to go on 78 minutes, having come on as a half-time sub, for a reckless lunge on Bees midfielder Alan Judge. And former Manchester United striker Macheda followed him to the dressing room with minutes remaining for a second yellow card. That sparked a frantic spell of pressure from Brentford which saw James Tarkoswski head over when well placed and Tommy Smith's goal-bound drive blocked by a melee of City bodies as Russell Slade's men held on. Cardiff almost snatched a third deep into stoppage time, but Kenwyne Jones squandered a gilt-edged chance to give the scoreline a flattering feel by blazing over after racing on to a through ball with the home defence committed. CHARLTON 1-3 BLACKBURN . A clinical double from Blackburn striker Jordan Rhodes ensured victory against lacklustre Charlton. It was Blackburn\u2019s third win of the season over Charlton, having already beaten them 2-0 in the reverse fixture and 2-1 in the FA Cup at the Valley. Blackburn keeper Jason Steele takes out Charlton Athletic's Igor Vetokele and gives away a penalty . Alex Baptiste of Blackburn and Igor Vetokele chase after the ball . Gary Bowyer\u2019s side have now lost only one of their last nine games in all competitions, and the win keeps alive slim play-off hopes. Craig Conway was also on target for Blackburn, while Yoni Buyens pulled one back from the spot. Bowyer was delighted with Scottish international Rhodes, and said: \u2018I thought his two goals were outstanding quality. The second one is a great piece of poaching and a sublime finish, and the first one is an unbelievable finish from a great bit of quick play from us.\u2019 LEEDS 0-0 NOTTINGHAM FOREST . Dougie Freedman was happy to go home with a draw after Nottingham Forest\u2019s stalemate at Leeds. Forest had won six of their first eight games under the Scot to raise hopes of a late run to the play-offs. There was no denying Forest had the better moments as Chris Burke and Ben Osborn drew smart saves from Leeds keeper Marco Silvestri, but they could not get past the Italian and headed back down the M1 with a point. Freedman said: \u2018I\u2019m happy with a point. Because of the run we\u2019re on and the standards we\u2019ve set, we expect to win games. \u2018We have to be realistic and to come to Leeds and get a point is a good result. We were the better team, and we had better chances.\u2019 ROTHERHAM 1-2 WIGAN . Wigan kept survival hopes alive as two free-kicks from Jermaine Pennant helped close the gap on Rotherham. The win was Malky Mackay\u2019s side\u2019s fourth straight away victory, and gives them a glimmer of hope ahead of the end-of-season run in. Mackay said: \u2018Jermaine\u2019s delivery on both was sensational. It\u2019s not until you look at it again that you see exactly what he did, and how he has executed them.\u2019 Matt Derbyshire pulled one back, but it was not enough to save Rotherham. BIRMINGHAM 1-1 HUDDERSFIELD . Joe Lolley, a product of Birmingham\u2019s academy, returned to St Andrew\u2019s to earn Huddersfield a rare away point with a vital equaliser. Huddersfield Town's Joe Lolley (far right) scores the equaliser against Birmingham . Making only his third start since being signed from Kidderminster for \u00a3300,000 a year ago, the 22-year-old justified manager Chris Powell\u2019s decision to play him against his former club when he cancelled out David Cotterill\u2019s opener. Powell said: \u2018Joe is a real natural talent, but I would like to see the day when he can last 90 minutes. \u2018We are just trying to cajole him. We are trying to get that talent shown regularly out on the pitch.\u2019 SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY 1-1 FULHAM . Stuart Gray felt his Sheffield Wednesday side should have been given a free-kick for diving in the build-up to Fulham\u2019s equaliser. Fulham striker Matt Smith is surrounded by Sheffield Wednesday players . Fulham midfielder Ryan Tunnicliffe went down in the Wednesday area before poking the ball to goalscorer Matt Smith in the 75th minute. The goal cancelled out a header from Wednesday substitute Stevie May. Gray said: \u2018I think the referee shouted play-on because he presumed the lad had dived. That\u2019s what the lads are saying, so if he thought he dived you would have thought he\u2019d have pulled up and given us a free-kick. You\u2019re taught as a kid to play until the whistle goes, and we did seem to stop.\u2019 BOLTON 2-0 MILLWALL . Neil Lennon described Adam Le Fondre as a \u2018priceless commodity\u2019 after watching his on-loan striker shoot down Millwall. Bolton's Paddy McCarthy (left) challenges Lee Gregory of Millwall . Le Fondre now has five goals in 10 games since his arrival from Cardiff, and Bolton boss Lennon said: \u2018They were two great finishes, and he is our joint second top-scorer and he has only been in the building since late January. \u2018It is a priceless commodity being a goalscorer, and he has done that his whole career.\u2019 New Millwall manager Neil Harris admitted: \u2018We are in a difficult position, and there are no promises from anyone in the dressing room as to what we are going to do.\u2019 BRIGHTON 1-1 WOLVES . A late goal from Rajiv van La Parra rescued a point for play-off chasers Wolves. Spanish defender Bruno Saltor raised hopes of a fourth successive home win for Brighton, but Wolves hit back to equalise four minutes later when Van La Parra\u2019s cross went in off David Stockdale. The Brighton keeper then produced a brilliant late save to deny Bakary Sako, and Wolves manager Kenny Jackett said: \u2018It was a close game, and a fantastic save at the end to deny us. \u2018We have to keep pushing. Two teams above us lost and we have two important games coming up. We would have loved three points, but thin dividing lines decide games. \u2018A number of clubs are looking for promotion, and it is still open for us.\u2019",

        "document": "A vitriolic letter written by the future King Edward VIII in which he branded the French Canadians 'rotten' and 'the completest passengers' during a tour of the country has emerged 96 years later. The Prince of Wales - the eldest son of King George V and Queen Mary - could not hide his resentment towards the French Canadians in the private letter he penned on a visit to Quebec. In the letter written a few months after World War One to his mistress Freda Dudley Ward, the 25-year-old Edward expresses his disgust at their reluctance to support the British Empire. Resentment: The Prince of Wales, pictured in November 1919 during his tour of Canada, criticised the French Canadians in a private letter calling them 'shirkers in everything particularly in war' Contempt: The future King Edward VIII scoffed at the French Canadians during his royal tour (pictured here) Stinging: In the letters, Edward describes the French Canadians as 'mostly a rotten priest-ridden community' In the recently unearthed letter, he says: ''These bloody French Canadians. 'The whole thing is a very delicate,\u00a0imperial and political question which I don't attempt to understand though I do know they are mostly a rotten priest-ridden community, who are the completest passengers and who won't do their bit in anything and of course the war!!' After catching a train for Toronto he wrote of how he was relieved to be leaving the French Canadians. He added: 'They really aren't worth all the trouble I've taken to be out of the way polite to them, as they are shirkers in everything particularly in war as they all voted against conscription.' The First World War divided Canada, with the French-speaking population accused of not doing enough to fight against the Germans. Later on in the letter to the married socialite, the Prince of Wales derided the attractiveness of the local women. He described one of his hostesses as 'pompous and interfering'. Detailing a formal dinner he had attended, he quipped: 'Few of the women are worth dancing with and far less are in any way attractive.' At another party at a yacht club, he complained how there were '100 very plain women' there. Disgust: Edward said the French Canadians 'really aren't worth all the trouble' as they are 'shirkers, particularly\u00a0war as they all voted against conscription' - he is pictured here in Nova Scotia, Canada, in 1919 . French Canadians are a major North American ethnic group and Canadian citizens derived from the descendants of colonists from France who arrived in New France (Canada) in the 17th and 18th centuries. When war was declared in 1914, Canada automatically entered as it was part of the British Empire. But by 1917 French Canadians only made up 21,000 out of 432,000 men, despite making up one third of the Canadian population. The French Canadians opposed conscription as they felt that they had no real loyalty to either Britain or France. The six-page letter was written by the future King to married mother-of-two Mrs Dudley Ward, years before he gave up the throne in order to marry\u00a0American divorcee Wallis Simpson. Then 23, the socialite was married to Liberal MP William Dudley Ward, who apparently turned a blind eye to the affair. The letter is due to be sold tomorrow by International\u00a0Autograph Auctions (IAA) at Nottingham Racecourse. It is expected to fetch \u00a31,200 when it goes under the hammer. Richard Davie, of IAA, said: 'The Prince of Wales was a very patriotic gentleman and was known for wearing his heart on his sleeve. 'He obviously would have attended lots of dinners and events in Canada and gave very polite and diplomatic speeches but this letter to someone he trusted very much reveals his real innermost thoughts. 'He still clearly felt troubled by the role played by the French Canadians in the Great War, feeling they shirked their responsibilities. 'I am quite sure he intended these thoughts to remain private and never expected them to become public at any time.' Edward abdicated in 1936 (pictured addressing the nation) so he could marry American Wallis Simpson . Edward was an army officer during the First World War. Although as heir to the throne he was prevented from fighting, he made a number of moral-boosting trips to the Western Front and was very popular with the troops. Edward was the Prince of Wales from 1911 until 1936 when he became King, a reign that only lasted 11 months when he abdicated so he could marry American  Wallis Simpson. The Prime Minster and many others opposed the union because Wallis had already been divorced once and was in the process of divorcing her second husband, so the King chose to abdicate instead of giving up his lover. His younger brother George, who served in the Royal Navy during the war, succeeded Edward as King in 1936, the details of which are popularised in the film 'The King's Speech' starring Colin Firth.",

        "document": "Convicted criminals could be banned from smoking in the communal areas of prisons after a landmark court ruling. A High Court judge in London has declared that the 2006 Health Act, which prohibits lighting up in public and in workplaces, applies to all Crown premises, including prisons. It comes after Mr Justice Singh rejected Justice Secretary Chris Grayling's argument that the Crown had immunity from the Act. Criminals could be banned from smoking in the communal areas of prisons following a landmark ruling at the High Court in London . However, the judge accepted his ruling had wide-ranging implications and said it should not take effect until Mr Grayling has had a chance to appeal. The judge was told by Government lawyers that criminalising smoking could lead to unrest in the jails of England and Wales. Prisoners can smoke in their cells with the door shut and outside in exercise yards, but both inmates and staff could face prosecution for lighting up in communal areas if the ruling is not overturned on appeal. The case was brought by Paul Black, an inmate at HMP Wymott in Lancashire, who says he suffers from a range of health problems made worse by second-hand smoke. High Court judge Mr Justice Singh, pictured, made the ruling after rejecting the argument that Crown premises had immunity from the Health Act 2006, which bans smoking in public places and in workplaces . Lawyers for Black, a sex offender who has been at Wymott since 2009, argued both prisoners and staff were guilty of lighting-up in areas prohibited under prison rules, including on landings, in laundry rooms and in healthcare waiting rooms. Lawyers for the Justice Secretary maintained the rules and regulations, especially the sanction of withdrawal of privileges, were sufficient to deal any problem. The Health Act already applies to private prisons as they are not Crown premises. Mr Justice Singh, sitting in London, declared: 'In my judgment it is clear from the terms of the 2006 Act that the intention of Parliament was indeed that it should apply to all public places and workplaces which fell within its scope, including those for which the Crown is responsible.' But giving permission to appeal, the judge acknowledged concerns in the Prison Service over the impact of his decision on 'prisoners who feel the need to smoke and may be resistant to the criminalising of that conduct in places where in my view the Health Act does apply.' Black had also argued that prisoners were legally entitled to anonymous and confidential access to the NHS freephone smoke-free compliance line to report infringements of the rules. The judge said that issue should be reconsidered by the Justice Secretary in the light of his judgment. Black is serving a sentence of indeterminate detention for public protection (IPP) after being convicted in 2007 of sexual assault and outraging public decency. His minimum term in jail expired after 203 days but he cannot be released on licence until the Parole Board decides he is no longer a danger to the public. The case was brought to the High Court by\u00a0Paul Black, an inmate at HMP Wymott in Lancashire, pictured, who says he suffers from a range of health problems made worse by second-hand smoke . Black's solicitor Sean Humber, head of the Prison Law Team at Leigh Day, said: 'The judgment confirms that the legal restrictions on smoking apply every bit as much in prisons as in the public places and workplaces in the wider community. 'The judgment is important in confirming that prisoners are entitled to the same level of protection from the risks posed by second-hand smoke as everyone else.' However, a Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said; 'Prison cells in England remain exempt from the smoke-free legislation that came into effect in 2007. 'Since that time we have introduced a number of measures to reduce the risk of exposure of staff and prisoners to second-hand smoke. We are undertaking additional measures to continue to lessen the impact of smoking in prisons. 'This includes tightening our current smoking controls, undertaking air quality monitoring in prison accommodation, and maximising the provision of smoking cessation support to those prisoners who want to stop smoking.'",

        "document": "Kell Brook has vowed not to make the same mistake as the man from whom he ripped the world crown when he makes the first defence of his IBF welterweight title in Sheffield on Saturday night. Brook takes on Canada-based Romanian Jo Jo Dan in a bout which bears all the hallmarks of a triumphant homecoming before the 28-year-old sets his sights on much more lucrative 147lbs assignments. Brook had himself been considered a convenient underdog when he went to California in August and surprised the incumbent champion Shawn Porter to wrest the belt by split decision. Kell Brook (left) poses alongside Jo Jo Dan ahead of their IBF welterweight title fight in Sheffield . Promoter Eddie Hearn sits in between Brook and Dan as they discuss Saturday evening's fight . Brook will not make the mistake of underestimating Dan, according to his trainer Dominic Ingle . And his extraordinary recovery following a life-threatening stabbing while on holiday in Tenerife last September has left Brook in no mood to make assumptions about how his first bout in his home city since October 2013 is going to end. Brook's trainer Dominic Ingle said: 'Shawn Porter under-estimated Kell Brook and believed his own hype and then he was forced to admit he had over-looked him. 'There is no danger of Kell overlooking Jo Jo in the same way. Jo Jo has got into the mandatory position and he wants to win that title. Kell is looking for big fights ahead but Jo Jo sees no reason why he shouldn't get them too.' Brook's long recovery since the horrific and unprovoked stabbing incident has left Ingle convinced he will step into the ring on Saturday in the shape of his life - even if his long slog to super-fitness did come at a price. Brook and Dan stare each other out as they go face-to-face in front of the media on Thursday afternoon . Hearn poses alongside Brook and Dan as the champion proudly shows off his IBF welterweight belt . Brook will make the first defence of his title in Sheffield after recovering from being stabbed in the leg last year . 'It's been a long camp and it's sometimes been boring and a bit like groundhog day but he's done all the work and the result is that his fitness is through the roof,' added Ingle. 'Because of the injury he has mentally over-compensated and he has really had to kick up a gear to get himself fit. It has been 30 weeks since he started rehab but he is fitter now than he was for the Porter fight. 'He is fighting on his home ground on Saturday and that will improve his performance by another 10 or 20 per cent. But the fact Jo Jo has come over to take his title will raise his game as well.'",

        "document": "Bump on the head or not, Fernando Alonso is the same wily maverick he always was. This most brilliant yet political of drivers, who is apt to spell the word team with the pronoun \u2018I\u2019, delivered his disloyal lines here yesterday quietly, courteously and devastatingly. A steering problem, he told a press conference before Sunday\u2019s Malaysian Grand Prix, was the cause of the McLaren driver\u2019s apparently innocuous accident during pre-season testing in Barcelona last month. Just one thing: McLaren repeatedly said there was nothing wrong with their car. Calling on every conceivable bit of tele-metry, they compiled a 37-page report, which they presented to the FIA, substantiating that view. Fernando Alonso stands in front of the world's press as he poses for the cameras ahead of Sunday's race . The Spaniard is back in action this weekend after missing the season-opening Australian Grand Prix . Alonso has claimed his steering wheel locked which caused his pre-season testing crash in Barcelona . \u2018The steering problem came in the middle of turn three,\u2019 elaborated Alonso, who missed the opening race in Melbourne as he recovered from the crash that threatened his career. \u2018It locked into the right and when I approached the wall I braked at the last moment, I downshifted from fifth to third, and unfortunately we are still missing some data.\u2019 How routine steering data would not be readily available baffled most observers, including a host of former drivers. \u2018I\u2019ve listened to Alonso\u2019s very clear explanation of the incident,\u2019 said broadcaster Martin Brundle, who drove in 158 grands prix. \u2018Now I\u2019m really confused.\u2019 One of the FIA\u2019s most senior technical officials commended McLaren\u2019s report as honest and robust. Why, then, would the Spaniard blame a steering problem when there is apparently no supporting evidence? Alonso is set for his second McLaren debut after he left the team at the end of the 2007 campaign . The Spaniard was in good spirits as he addressed the media in Sepang after being declared fit to race . The two most obvious reasons are that he was either too proud to admit he made an error, or a possible neurological glitch caused him to black out prior to hitting the wall (even though he was changing gears, he may have been semi-conscious as he did so). It appears he did not mention any steering problem to McLaren until last week - three weeks after the accident. They then smuggled a quotation from him citing this explanation into the middle of a press release on Monday, perhaps to appease him. What they did not expect was Alonso to make such a fuss about the issue when he spoke in the Sepang paddock. That left McLaren snookered. They could not disregard their meticulous data, nor could they publicly argue with their \u00a325million-a-year driver - relations between the team and Alonso still have not entirely recovered from the fractious year he spent at McLaren in 2007. Alonso barely speaks to Ron Dennis, the McLaren chairman. His relationship with the de facto team principal Eric Boullier, who was not at McLaren during Alonso\u2019s first spell there, is somewhat more trusting but he is closer to Andrea Stella, an Italian who moved with him from Ferrari to remain his race engineer. These scenes echoed 2007, when Alonso threatened to report incriminating evidence about Dennis to the FIA during the Spygate scandal. Alonso arrives in the Sepang paddock for the Malaysian Grand Prix; the second round of the championship . The double world champion in the paddock with compatriot Carlos Sainz prior to Thursday's media briefing . Back then, the team were split in two. Alonso and his manager Luis Garcia Abad would brief Spanish journalists in one corner. The same procedure happened at the team\u2019s hospitality area here on Thursday. Alonso was again surrounded by his cabal - Abad and his deputy Alberto Fernandez, and physiotherapist Edoardo Bendinelli - as he ate jacket potatoes as part of the so-called \u2018boys\u2019 lunch\u2019 ... the meal provided for the team\u2019s mechanics and engineers. By this point, Alonso, who arrived at the track at 9.45am, had been cleared by the FIA\u2019s doctors to compete on Sunday, a virtual formality after he passed more extensive tests by three Cambridge University doctors at the weekend. Yet still the mystery goes on. Alonso said he was \u2018perfectly conscious at the time\u2019 of the accident - a version of events that seems to contradicts with McLaren\u2019s public statements and eyewitness accounts at the scene. Alonso insisted he will have no problems stepping back into the cockpit for first practice on Friday . Alonso smiles in his car in the garage at Sepang, home of this weekend's Malaysian Grand Prix . \u2018I lost consciousness in the ambulance or in the clinic at the circuit but the doctors said this is normal because of the medication they gave me for the helicopter transfer and the checks they did in hospital,\u2019 he said. \u2018There is a time I don\u2019t remember from two o\u2019clock to six o\u2019clock, but that was normal on the medication.\u2019 Alonso more plausibly denied reports originating in Spain that he woke up believing himself to be a teenage go-karter. He said he could remember everything the following day, but then said it took him \u2018three or four days\u2019 to gather his memory. Baffling. But not for his team-mate Jenson Button, who said: \u2018I\u2019ve seen every single bit of data many times. Nothing has changed. It all says that the car is OK.\u2019 It was Button\u2019s polite way of saying what we were all thinking about the confused nature of Alonso\u2019s testimony.",

        "document": "Three men have been charged by police investigating disorder which marred Aston Villa's FA Cup quarter-final victory over West Brom. West Midlands Police said the men, aged between 26 and 37, had been charged with offences connected to the match after officers made a total of 17 arrests inside and outside Villa Park. Play was halted in the closing minutes of Saturday's cup tie at Villa Park after home supporters invaded the playing area before the final whistle. The pitch at Villa Park can barely be seen as supporters stream onto the turf following the full-time whistle . Police clash with supporters on the pitch after Aston Villa's FA Cup clash with local rivals West Brom . West Brom goalkeeper Boaz Myhill is mocked by an Aston Villa fan following the home side's second goal . Away fans also threw missiles, including seats, during the second half of the match, while police had to form cordons to keep rival supporters apart. Police said Matthew Fox, 27, from Stourbridge, has been charged with assaulting a police officer and bailed to appear at Birmingham Magistrates' Court on March 19. Meanwhile, 37-year-old Matthew Owen, a designer from Walsall, has been charged with using threatening words or behaviour with intent. He has been bailed to appear at the same court on the same date. Unemployed David Moore, 26, from Birmingham, has been charged with failing to comply with a football banning notice and was due to appear in court today. Police have also issued six men with fixed penalty notices for public order offences or being drunk and disorderly. Two other men suspected of assaulting a police officer have been bailed pending further inquiries, while a 16-year-old boy from Kingswinford, near Dudley, has been cautioned for using threatening words or behaviour. Trouble flared before, during and after the Villa Park showdown, including the pitch invasion . Chief Superintendent Chris Johnson, from West Midlands Police, said: 'We carried out a large policing operation for the FA Cup on Saturday evening to ensure supporters could enjoy the game in a safe environment. 'An investigation has been launched to identify people involved in a disturbance before the match at the Witton Arms pub. 'Anyone who saw what happened should contact police on 101 or call Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.' Police say the timing of the match was fully discussed with both clubs ahead of the game. Inspector Howard Lewis-Jones added: 'We were approached by Aston Villa with the proposed later kick off time and expressed concerns that this increased the likelihood of alcohol-fuelled disorder. 'As a result we increased the policing resources to deal with this increased threat. 'The encroachment of the pitch by Aston Villa supporters was a disappointing end to an exciting local derby and we continue to work with the Football Association and the club to identify those involved.' The Football Association has contacted both Aston Villa and West Brom to request their observations in relation to the 'disturbing' crowd trouble which occurred during and after Villa's 2-0 win.",

The official, who was not authorized to be quoted by name due to government policy, said Trevino Morales, 41, was arrested in a pre-dawn raid in San Pedro Garza Garcia, a wealthy suburb of the northern city of Monterrey. The Mexican government had offered a $2million reward for his capture on weapons and organized crime charges. Scroll down for video . Soldiers escort a man identified as Omar Trevino Morales, the leader of the Zetas drug cartel,  in Mexico City . Morales, also known as Z-42 is taken under custody to the Attorney General Office's hangar at the airport . The US Drug Enforcement Administration, which had Morales on its 'Most Wanted' list, had offered a $5million reward for his capture on cocaine-trafficking charges. Trevino may also face charges for several abductions and murders. Trevino's give name is Alejandro, but he has had multiple aliases and nicknames, including 'Omar,' '42' and 'Commandante 42.' The arrest of Morales comes just days after the capture of Servando 'La Tuta' Gomez, leader of the Knights Templar drug gang, who was the the most wanted capo still at large in Mexico.

Soldiers escort a man who authorities identified as\u00a0Omar Trevino Morales, whose aliases include 'Omar,' '42' and 'Commandante 42' The suspect is the brother of Miguel Angel Trevino Morales, described as the most bloodthirsty leader of Mexico's most violent organized crime group. Miguel Angel was arrested in July 2013, almost a year after marines killed the Zetas' other biggest leader, Heriberto Lazcano 'El Lazca.' \u2018Omar Trevino was the heir to all the Zetas who were going down,\u2019 said Raul Benitez, a security expert at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. The Zetas carved a path of brutality, bloodshed and mutilated bodies across northern Mexico during their turf battles with the rival Gulf cartel, claiming upwards of 100,000 lives since 2007. The suspect is the brother of Miguel Angel Trevino Morales, who is described as the most bloodthirsty leader of Mexico's most violent organized crime group .

Once the flashpoint for the worst of the violence, security in northern Mexico has improved considerably, except for the lawless northeastern border state of Tamaulipas, said Raul Benitez. Founded in the late 1990s by deserters from an elite Mexican army unit, the Zetas initially acted as enforcers for the powerful Gulf cartel, based along the border with Texas and one of the oldest criminal syndicates in Mexico. But the group struck out on its own in early 2010, setting off the most violent phase in Mexico's drug war.

The Ibrox outfit had lost all three previous Championship meetings with Alan Stubbs\u2019 men by a crushing 9-1 aggregate scoreline, but turned the tables at Easter Road in a result which also meant the Tynecastle club were officially promoted as second-tier champions. Goals from Lee Wallace and Kenny Miller \u2014 the latter strongly disputed by Hibs \u2014 gave McCall a first win in charge and hoisted the Rangers to within three points of their second-placed hosts with a game in hand. Stuart McCall celebrates watching his side beat Hibernian 2-0 at Easter Road on Sunday . There is a fair chance the two sides could meet again in the play-offs and McCall admitted it was essential his side stopped the rot against their Leith rivals. \u2018First and foremost I would like to congratulate Hearts on an outstanding season and winning the title,\u2019 said the Ibrox boss, who drew his first two matches in charge. \u2018Robbie Neilson and his team have been outstanding all season, so fair play to them. \u2018I am delighted with our performance and the result but it\u2019s only one game, we won\u2019t get carried away. But it will restore a bit of confidence that has been severely lacking. \u2018It\u2019s a stepping stone. But if we are to hopefully get back into the top league at the end of the season then we\u2019re likely going to have to play Hibs in a decider. \u2018If we had come here and got beat today then psychologically it wouldn\u2019t have been good, so this will help. But we have a long way to go. \u2018We want to go into the play-offs with momentum, with a bit of spirit and confidence and players playing at the level they can play.\u2019 Rangers had drawn their five previous games and travelled to Easter Road on the back of just one win in nine.

That dire run had left Ibrox fans despairing about their promotion hopes but McCall, who earned joy from switching to a 3-5-2 shape, feels his team have now shown they are good enough to go up. \u2018Yes, that\u2019s all we want from them,\u2019 he said. \u2018Whatever is past has now gone \u2014 even today has now gone. There are players in there who need a bit of belief and confidence. A performance like today can only help. \u2018I said to the players, there is only one thing better than winning and that is winning as an underdog, when people don\u2019t expect it of you. There is a long way to go and we won\u2019t be getting carried away but it helps with the confidence, morale and belief.\u2019 Rangers fans chanted McCall\u2019s name as the minutes ticked away at Easter Road but he played down the formation rejig that drew a radically improved display. \u2018Listen I am no master tactician or anything like that,\u2019 he said. \u2018We played a shape and it worked but that was down to the players who carried out what we wanted them to do. \u2018You can talk about formations and tactics, whatever, but the bottom line is if the players show the desire and the willingness and the ability like they did today, then it\u2019s about players and them doing the jobs they are asked to do.

        "document": "Police in Oakland, California, say they have found no evidence to link murder suspect Robert Durst to the 1997 disappearance of Charlotte teenager Kristen Modafferi. Durst, the subject of HBO's documentary series The Jinx, was arrested last weekend and was charged on Monday by L.A. officials in connection with the 2000 murder of his friend Susan Berman. In the wake of Durst's arrest, Oakland police revealed that they and the FBI were looking into the possiblility that he was somehow involved in Modafferi's disappearance. Scroll down for video . Police in Oakland, California, say they have found no evidence to link murder suspect Robert Durst to the 1997 disappearance of Charlotte teenager Kristen Modafferi . The 18-year-old student from North Carolina had gone missing after finishing work in San Francisco on June 23, 1997. Durst was rumored to be living in the area around that time, reports The Wrap. 'The Oakland Police Department conducted an investigation with the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation regarding the 1997 disappearance of Kristen Modafferi,' said the police in a statement on Thursday. 'The investigation was open and active for several years. At this time we do not have any evidence that indicates Robert Durst was involved in her disappearance.' Police in Eureka, California, do however remain interested in Durst in connection with another missing persons case. Karen Mitchell, 16, was last seen on November 25, 1997 after leaving her aunt's Eureka home. Robert Durst grinned as he was transported from Orleans Parish Criminal District Court to the Orleans Parish Prison after his arraignment on Tuesday . Eureka police said on Tuesday they would like to speak to Durst about his possible connection with the disappearance of Karen Mitchell, who was 16 when she went missing from Eureka, California, in 1997 . Durst had reportedly visited the aunt's store dressed in drag. Investigative journalist Matt Birkbeck said on CNN this week that Durst frequented a homeless shelter where Mitchell volunteered, and he drove a car matching the description of one seen near the location where the girl vanished. Durst's arrest in New Orleans came the day before the finale of HBO series, The Jinx, about his links to the three killings. On the final episode, Durst made an apparent confession, saying in an unguarded moment: 'I killed them all, of course.' On Tuesday, Durst was transferred to a prison wing for the mentally ill in New Orleans while he awaits extradition to LA to face the first-degree murder charge. Questions also surfaced over his links to two missing California girls. The troubled real estate heir was moved to the acute mental health facility at Elayn Hunt Correctional Center in Louisiana because he is considered a suicide risk, according to the sheriff's office on Wednesday. Durst has been charged with murder over the execution-style shooting of friend, Susan Berman, 15 years ago in LA. He also has been suspected - but never charged - in the disappearance of his first wife, Kathleen McCormack, in New York. In 2003, Durst was acquitted of murder after he admitted to killing a neighbor in self-defense, dismembering him and throwing the body parts in Galveston Bay, Texas. He admitted that he had shot neighbor, Morris Black, in the defense but that his actions were self-defense. At the time, Durst was living as an odd and mute woman, named Dorothy Ciner. Durst's lawyer does not believe his client suffers from acute mental illness, according to a brief filed by the sheriff's office on Tuesday. A three-judge panel ruled that the sheriff has sole authority to decide where to house inmates needing mental health treatment.",

        "document": "New Zealand reached their first ever World Cup final as they secured a sensational four-wicket Duckworth/Lewis win over South Africa at a sold out Eden Park on Tuesday. An explosive 49 off 18 balls from South African batsman David Miller saw New Zealand set 298 (D/L) to chase for victory, after a burst of rain reduced the match to 43 overs per side. In response, Brendon McCullum blazed his way to 59 and despite the regular loss of wickets, Grant Elliott smashed the penultimate ball for six to lead New Zealand to a tense victory. Grant Elliott celebrates after smashing the winning runs as New Zealand reached their first ever final . South Africa missed chances in the field, JP Duminy and Ferhaan Berhardian colliding at a crucial moment . Faf du Plessis and Farhaan Behardien cannot believe it after a crucial drop which reprieved Elliott .

Vettori (left) leads his team-mates on a lap of honour to show appreciation for the home fans . Imran Tahir wipes away a tear after South Africa again failed to reach the final of a World Cup . The dejection is clear to see on the faces of the South Africans, after they failed to make it over the line . There was an added spice to the match with neither side having ever previously made it past the semi-finals. New Zealand\u2019s own dismal record of six defeats out of six at this stage of the tournament was a disappointment the native supporters were confident their side would finally overcome in Auckland. But, following their quarter-final victory over Sri Lanka, South African captain AB de Villiers said his side embraced the tag of \u2018chokers\u2019 and were striving under the pressure. Having won the toss South Africa chose to bat first and the continued rotation of their side saw Vernon Philander replace the heretofore-impressive Kyle Abbott. With arguably the best attack of the World Cup, New Zealand\u2019s pace bowlers Trent Boult and Tim Southee were successfully swinging the ball and causing the opposition openers all sorts of problems. AB de Villiers falls over the stumps after failing to gather the ball cleanly to run out Corey Anderson . The anguish is clear on De Villiers' face as he let the momentum shift away from South Africa in the semi final . De Villiers has been one of South Africa's stars of the tournament, but his mistake cost his side dear . New Zealand celebrate after taking a wicket during the first innings of their semi-final against South Africa . Du Plessis top-scored for South Africa with 82, as the Proteas scored 281 in a rain-interrupted innings . Corey Anderson, who was expensive but took three of five wickets, celebrates Rilee Roussow's dismissal . David Miller blasted three sixes in his quickfire 49, which boosted the South African score at the end . Somewhat surprisingly the Black Caps\u2019 fielding early on let them down, as first Quinton De Kock was dropped on six by wicketkeeper Luke Ronchi off Boult. Hashim Amla was then put down three balls later on naught at long leg, with Boult the guilty party this time, after he hit a top-edge off Southee. Nonetheless, the tournaments leading wicket-taker redeemed himself in the following over as Boult followed up a bouncer with an in-swinger that took Amla\u2019s (10) inside edge and cannoned into middle stump, with Eden Park erupting in jubilation. Attempting to release the shackles, De Kock (14) shuffled down the wicket to Boult and as he swung hard at a full ball, a thick edge flew to third man and South Africa were reduced to 31 for two after eight overs. Slow starts coupled with explosive finishes have the been framework for many of De Villiers side\u2019s innings during this World Cup and their efforts in Auckland was following the same suit. Required to rebuild, Faf du Plessis and Rillee Rossouw put on an 83-run third-wicket partnership to steady the ship. De Villiers hit another impressive 65, continuing his excellent form, as South Africa accelerated their innings . The South African captain salutes the crowd after reaching yet another half century . However, McCullum brought on Corey Anderson and he sent down a bouncer that hit the shoulder of the Rossouw\u2019s bat and was caught one-handed by Martin Guptill at backwards point to dismiss the left-handed batsman for 39. As De Villier\u2019s came to the crease he was once again required to provide a rescue mission but was almost dismissed on his first delivery as he nearly gloved the ball onto the stumps. But, the right-handed batsman remained un-fazed and in typical style he took the attack to the opposition. Kane Williamson committed the cardinal sin of dropping the South African captain and New Zealand were made to pay as the next three balls were dispatched to the boundary rope. As Du Plessis and De Villier\u2019s partnership passed the 100-run mark some unscheduled rain arrived to check their progress on 216-3 after 38 overs. It was an interruption that undoubtedly favoured New Zealand, just as South Africa looked like they were ready to explode and by the time the skies cleared the match was reduced to 43 overs per side. Having anchored his sides innings Du Plessis was dismissed for 82 off the second ball after the restart, as he gloved a bouncer from Anderson to Ronchi behind the stumps. For South Africa it turned out to be the perfect catalyst for an exciting end as Miller entered and smashed six fours and three sixes in his quick-fire 49. With 65 runs hit off their final five overs after the delay the Proteas posted 281-5, setting New Zealand a challenging 298 (D/L) to win. Brendon McCullum flicks the ball away as he got New Zealand off to a blistering start in their chase . McCullum's combination of clever shotmaking and explosive power set New Zealand up for a win . Morne Morkel hit back for South Africa, dismissing McCullum and Kane Williamson in quick succession . McCullum, who has become known for thriving on leading from the front, signaled his intent in the first over of his sides innings as he sent a short Dale Steyn delivery over extra cover for a maximum. Although Guptill - fresh from hitting a record 237 against the West Indies in fourth quarter-final - was looking uncomfortable, his captain was in full flow at the other end and reached his half-century off just 22 balls. South Africa\u2019s pace bowlers were bleeding runs so De Villiers turned to his energetic spinner Imran Tahir and a tight first over applied a bit of pressure on the batsmen. And, McCullum (59) succumbed attempting to resume clearing the ropes in the next over as he came dancing down the wicket to Morne Morkel and having failed to connect properly could only pick out Steyn at mid-on. Williamson then lasted just 11 balls before he bottom-edged a short Morkel delivery and shattered his stumps on six. New Zealand were faltering and Ross Taylor was guilty for calling for a single and selling Guptill short as he found himself run-out for a scratchy 34. Quinton de Kock runs out Martin Guptill after a mix-up with Ross Taylor as the hosts faltered in Auckland . Duminy (left) celebrates with Du Plessis as South Africa appeared to take control of the contest . Taylor was caught behind for 30, as New Zealand struggled to keep up with the rate . It was fifth bowler JP Duminy who then provided the next crucial breakthrough for South Africa as Taylor was brilliantly caught behind by De Kock for a run-a-ball 30. The match continued to ebb and flow with neither side taking full control of the game before the game changing moment occurred in the 32nd over. As Elliott pushed the ball to point, Anderson called for a run and as he was sent back De Villiers missed a golden opportunity to run-out the stranded batsmen, hitting the stumps with his hand instead of the ball. A superb 103-run fifth-wicket partnership between Elliott and Anderson looked to have taken New Zealand to the brink of victory. However, Anderson skied a Morkel delivery to Du Plessis at square-leg for 58 and Ronchi holed-out in the deep for eight as the tension out in the middle and in the stands stepped up another notch. Anderson (above) and Elliot settled the hosts' nerves with a brilliant partnership of 103 . Anderson punished De Villiers for his missed run out as the game hurtled towards a tense climax . With New Zealand 273-6 and requiring another 26 runs off 16 balls, South Africa missed another crucial run-out opportunity, Elliott this time the lucky survivor. The 36-year-old right-handed batsmen sent a length Morkel delivery high into the evening Auckland sky but the ball fell agonizingly between two Proteas players. Morkel\u2019s final delivery was again pulled high into the air by Elliott but just as Farhaan Behardien looked set to catch it Duminy ran across him as the ball dropped to the ground. Steyn, battling injury, was brought on for the final over with New Zealand requiring 12. And Eden Park erupted in euphoria as Elliott (84 not out) hit the penultimate ball for a maximum as the South African players collapsed to the ground in despair. There is an undeniably belief within the crowd that their side has one more victory in them that will bring New Zealand their elusive first World Cup title. Du Plessis keeps his cool to take a vital catch and dismiss Anderson, setting up a thrilling finish . Du Plessis cannot hide his jubilation as the semi-final came right down to the wire in Auckland . Duminy collides with Farhaan Berhadien to offer Elliott another reprieve in the penultimate over . Vettori (left) punches the air after Elliott smashed Steyn for six to win the match .",

Jonty Hurwitz's creations are so tiny they can rest on a human hair and are the same size of an ant's head. Having spent months working on the pieces, the 45-year-old from Chichester, West Sussex, took them to a photographer to have them pictured under a microscope. But within minutes his work had been destroyed by the stroke of the lab technician's finger. Scroll down for video . The world's smallest sculpture (seen in the eye of a needle, above) was accidentally destroyed by a photographer hired to help its creator capture it in pictures . The artwork, seen here on a human hair, was produced using 3D printing technolog by Jonty Hurwitz . 'I went off to have the original sculptures photographed so I found a laboratory with an electron microscope and the photographic technology,' said Mr Hurwitz. 'The technician went to change the orientation and then for the next half an hour we were looking for the piece through the lens. 'Eventually I noticed there was a fingerprint exactly where the sculpture used to be and I was like \"man you have just destroyed the smallest art pieces\" ever made - I slightly freaked out.' The sculptures are less than 1mm tall and are produced via a process called nano-painting. They are too small to be seen with the naked eye so must be viewed and photographed under a microscope. Mr Hurwitz uses a 3D printing technology to produce them. Describing the process on his website, he said: 'The structure is created using a ground-breaking new 3D printing technology and a technique called Multiphoton Lithography. Mr Hurwitz has produced a number of nano sculptures using the same technology though the naked woman above is believed to have been the smallest . The artist from Chichester, West Sussex, described his work as a combination of 'art and Quantum Physics' 'Ultimately these works are created using the physical phenomenon of two photon absorption. Art, literally created with Quantum Physics. 'This two photon absorption occurs only at the tiny focal point - basically a tiny 3D pixel (called a Voxel). 'The sculpture is then moved along fractionally by a computer controlled process and the next pixel is created. Slowly, over hours and hours the entire sculpture is assembled pixel by pixel and layer by layer.' The sculptures are believed to be the smallest representation of the human form ever created by man.",

The 50-year-old house husband was seen pushing three-year-old Jordan on the swings at a playground near to his house in downtown Manhattan yesterday. The pair later rushed across town to get pizza. Former US representative Anthony Weiner was spotted taking his son for a quick stroll near his downtown Manhattan home yesterday. They were seen enjoying themselves amid claims Weiner's wife has been caught up in the Hillary Clinton email scandal . They were spotted enjoying themselves as Weiner's wife Huma Abedin faces scrutiny about using a private email account. Abedin is one of three top Clinton aides who reportedly used email addresses hosted on the former secretary of state's private server. Senior figures in Congress were already investigating Clinton's communications from 2009-13, which they say were not conducted via official State Department accounts but a 'clintonemail.com' address. Clinton has handed over 55,000 pages of communications from the time - but admitted on Tuesday during a news conference that she deleted more than 30,000 emails she decided were personal in nature and unrelated to her job. The 50-year-old house husband made sure he pushed three-year-old Jordan high on the swings before the pair ran off to get pizza . The investigation has now widened after it emerged that one of Abedin's email addresses is Huma@clintonemail.com, showing that she could have also been using the server to conduct official business. Daily Mail Online confirmed the address through Lexis-Nexis, a commercial service that compiles public records. It comes nearly four years after Weiner's own scandal where he resigned from Congress for sending sexually suggestive photographs of himself via his public Twitter account to other women. Longtime Clinton aide Huma Abedin had an email address on the former secretary of state's private server, judging from records maintained by Lexis-Nexis . Abedin (left), shown with then-Secretary of State Clinton during a 2010 diplomatic meeting in Vietnam, was her deputy chief of staff and is expected to play a key roll if Clinton runs for president . At the time he admitted that he had sent images to six women in three years and said that he had stopped. But in 2013 further claims were made that he sent more under the alias 'Carlos Danger' to a 22-year-old woman. He tried to return to politics by taking part in the 2013 New York Mayoral race but lost after receiving less than five per cent of votes.",

It's from a few years ago. It shows Bian Liangjing standing proudly in front of a temple gate. \"This is the best one because he looks so handsome,\" she laughs as tears fall on to the album. Bian was on his way back from Singapore after working on a construction site to earn money to pay for his dentist's license. His boss decided it was cheaper to fly through Malaysia. He boarded the Beijing-bound Malaysian Airlines Flight 370 flight in Kuala Lumpur on March 8 last year when it disappeared barely an hour into its journey. No trace has ever been found despite an extensive search. But his mother is convinced he's coming back. \"If it is one year, if it is two years or three, I am looking forward to his return. I know he is still alive,\" she says. I first met family members of those who were on the airliner that night as they stood in shock at the arrivals hall of Beijing airport. I saw them every day for a month as they grappled with confusion and mixed messages from Malaysia Airlines and the Malaysian government. I was there when many received text messages saying \"none of those on board survived.\" Many had to be wheeled out on gurneys. Some lashed out at the cameras. The news cycle moved on but the families are still here. They are still in pain. And all the family members I speak to say their loved ones are alive. They never speak in the past tense, they cling onto each theory that is circulated and they refuse to sign any documents to start financial settlements. \"I think psychologically it is understandable, they choose to believe that their loved ones are still missing, so they can still have hope for them to return,\" says May Lam, a psychiatrist at The University of Hong Kong. She says the families need constant support from social workers and the government and they need to be helped to gradually accept their loss. But many say they are treated like an inconvenience. Families complain of harassment by local communist party officials, several have been detained by Chinese police for holding meetings and some say they have been barred from speaking to the international media. Both the Chinese and Malaysian governments maintain they are doing everything they can to help. Meanwhile, Bian Liangjing's family, like all the others I have met, is stuck in a vortex of grief. His brother shows me to the room where they would sleep as young boys and the corner where they kept their toys. Bian Liangwei says they were best friends and that his older brother looked after him. \"When he was here, everything was OK with our family, now everything is up to me. I hope he is somewhere alive. I just know he wants to come home soon to us,\" he says through his tears.",

The World is usually occupied by 150 to 200 residents or guests at a time, with the average owner spending three to six months on board over the course of a year. Since it launched in 2002 the floating city has visited more than 900 ports in more than 140 countries while sailing on a continuous worldwide itinerary at a maximum speed of 18.5 knots. This year The World set sail from Singapore and toured exotic islands in Southeast Asia before visiting Maldives and Seychelles. The luxury ocean liner is scheduled to arrive in Europe in April, with stops all over the Mediterranean Sea before sailing to Southampton in August. Amenities include swimming pools, the only full-size tennis court at sea, a 7,000-square foot spa and fitness centre and a sommelier . The itineraries are determined two to three years in advance by a community vote, and guests can stay on board as long as they want . From there it will visit Fowey in Cornwall before sailing to Dublin and on to the Faroe Islands, Iceland and Greenland while residents and guests are taken care of by a crew of 270. Before the end of the year the ship\u2019s residents, who are from more than 19 countries, will have visited Canada, the US and several countries in South America. The final expedition of 2015 will take them to the Antarctic Peninsula, where they will explore islands and see icebergs, glacier caves and snow-capped mountains. This year's itinerary will take passengers from Singapore to the Antarctic Peninsula, with stops in India, the UK and Greenland . Many expeditions take three to four years of planning and there are plenty of opportunities for inland excursions. This year\u2019s itinerary includes a seven-night trip from Delhi to Bangalore in India. With the average stay in port lasting 2.5 days, passengers have been fortunate to experience some incredible moments during their travels. In all, the ship will sail 41,000 nautical miles while visiting 104 ports of call and spending 77 days at sea. New stops include Colombo, Sri Lanka and Bazaruto Island in Mozambique. In 2012 residents and guests spotted polar bears on ice floes in the Arctic as The World became the largest passenger ship to sail the North West Passage. The World will sail 41,000 nautical miles while visiting 104 ports of call and spending 77 days at sea this year (pictured: tea garden) Passengers have sailed to a number of exotic locations, including the Sea of Okhotsk in the western Pacific Ocean .

        "document": "A woman has been left \u2018gobsmacked\u2019 after a camera, packed with memories of her once in a lifetime trip to Antarctica, is on its way back to her after she lost it three months ago on a snowy iceberg. Photographer Hulia Boz, from Sydney, was on an impromptu two-week holiday to the remote region costing around $13,000 after being invited along by friends who had a spare place on their trip. She\u2019d loaded her iPad up with episodes of American comedian Ellen DeGeneres\u2019s chat show to entertain her while travelling to Antarctica and had been watching a Robin Williams episode with her fellow travellers in the moments before she lost her camera. Packed around her tiny screen on a remote iceberg, surrounded by nothing but ice, snow, penguins and seals, Ms Boz and her tour group then decided to record a message to Ellen on her white Canon camera. \u2018We spent an open night on an iceberg, the only thing around us were penguins and seals lazing around. I took the camera out of my pocket and said \u201ceveryone let\u2019s do a very Merry Christmas from Antarctica to Ellen because she\u2019s entertaining us at the bottom of the earth\u201d,\u2019 Ms Boz explained. 'Nothing like a selfie to help identify a lost camera!': This is the distinctive photo that helped tour operator staff identify Hulia Boz from the photos on her lost camera . Moments after recording the festive message on December 12, on day seven of her trip to Earth's southernmost continent, Ms Boz got up to go to the \u2018bathroom\u2019. \u2018You\u2019ve got to build a wall from ice to go to the toilet. I went to do my wee and the camera must have fallen out of my pocket, I didn\u2019t realise,\u2019 she said. The 34-year-old was unaware that she\u2019d lost her white camera in the snow until she boarded the ship the next day and began unpacking her belongings. \u2018The ship started to pull away and I thought \u201cwhere is the camera? Where is the camera?\u201d and we thought \u201cno we were going to send it to Ellen!\u201d,\u2019 Ms Boz laughed. The story of how Ms Boz is now being reunited with her camera, which was white and camouflaged in the snow, is nothing short of a miracle. Before departing on the ship to Antarctica, Ms Boz and the rest of her tour group had mugshots taken at the port in Ushuaia, Argentina \u2013 the southernmost city in the world - where they sailed from. All tourists heading to Antarctica have these photos taken so they can be officially identified if need be. Photographer Hulia Boz, from Sydney, was on an impromptu two-week holiday to Antarctica when she lost her camera. She took the white Canon camera along on her trip so she could capture 'silly' photos and used her professional cameras for landscape photography . This picture shows Hulia's friend cosying up with a seal in Antarctica. Her friend took photos on her camera and shared them with Hulia when her camera was lost . She was lucky enough to get a spare place on the trip which cost her around $13,000 after being invited along by friends . Hulia and her fellow tourists were watching an Ellen DeGeneres episode before she lost her camera . A traveller with a different tour company, Quark Expeditions, miraculously found Ms Boz\u2019s camera in the snow on the same iceberg near Useful Island in February and took it back to the port in Ushuaia, where they handed it in. Polar Operations Manager for Aurora travel Tomas Holik was given the camera \u2018with no marking nor name on it\u2019 and looked through the pictures stored on it, leading him to figure out that it belonged to Ms Boz as he compared the photos to the mugshots taken from recent expeditions. 'Once they saw all the young faces in the recording they found a voyage that happened to have young people on it.... they then sent my selfie to the ship's team leaders asking if they knew who I was,' Ms Boz explained. \u2018By looking at its pictures I figured out that it belongs to a passenger of EAP27,\u2019 Mr Holik wrote in an email to the Sydney-based tour company that Ms Boz travelled with. Before Hulia knew that she would ever be reunited with her lost camera her friend sent her these photos that she had taken of her . The 34-year-old was unaware that she\u2019d lost her white camera in the snow until she boarded the ship the next day and began unpacking her belongings . Amongst the many memories from her two-week trip where plenty of fun selfies taken in the stunning snowy environment . The group were camping out on an iceberg in  Useful Island in December when she lost her camera . Assistant expedition leader Robyn Mundy replied: \u2018I am amazed and astonished that someone found the camera. And returned it! We looked for it on the following voyage but there was still too much snow cover to find a white camera.\u2019 \u2018It does indeed belong to one of our EAP27 passengers, Hulia Boz. Nothing like a selfie to help identify a lost camera! If you could possibly get it back to Sydney via a staff member or passenger, I\u2019m sure Hulia will be eternally grateful,\u2019 Ms Mundy replied. Ms Boz\u2019s camera, which amazingly still works, is now on its way back to Sydney. \u2018When they told me the person\u2019s flight details and the name I thought this is really real. I hadn\u2019t put out a plea on social media because there is nothing there but ice and penguins,' she said. Packed around her tiny screen on a remote iceberg, surrounded by nothing but ice, snow, penguins and seals, Ms Boz and her tour group then decided to record a message to Ellen on her white Canon camera . Hulia still intends to send the Christmas message to Ellen once her camera returns to her, even if it is a bit late . This photo shows the ship that the group travelled from Argentina to Antarctica in over four days . Hulia has called the trip and the surprise of someone finding her camera in the remote snow 'the most over whelming experience of my life' 'The effort, patience and goodwill that was put into reuniting me with my memories by strangers has amazed me. It has restored my faith in humanity. 'My camera was identified as my property by a selfie I had taken and the footage my friends and I had taken to send to Ellen DeGeneres as that was the last thing on the camera . 'I am one lucky person who is grateful and overwhelmed by this all. Miracles do happen. Even if Antarctica is twice as big as Australia. Even with no permanent residence. Even if the colour of my camera was white and would be difficult to detect on ice,' she said happily. 'This truly was and probably will be the most over whelming experience of my life. I met some amazing talented people who I shared some very special memories with, built friendships for life, did some crazy things and most of all have one amazing story to tell my grand kids one day.'",

        "document": "Dick Advocaat\u2019s appointment as Sunderland boss seemed complete on Monday night after he told Dutch TV that he had signed a contract until the end of the season. The 67-year-old will sign a short-term deal until the end of the season and his package will be incentivised with the target of survival. Advocaat told Voetbal International: 'I am now in a dark hotel, but soon I'll be working in the Stadium of Light.' Dick Advocaat, pictured here in charge of PSV Eindhoven in 2012, is set to take charge at Sunderland . Gus Poyet has been sacked by Sunderland with the club just one point above the relegation zone . Sunderland supporters turned on manager Poyet after their side were thrashed 4-0 by Aston Villa . 525 - Poyet's number of days in charge since his arrival on October 8, 2013. 75 - The Uruguayan's number of games in charge, winning 23, losing 22 and drawing 30. 3 - The number of games against bitter rivals Newcastle. He won them all with an aggregate of 6-1. 35 - Poyet was the 35th man to manage Sunderland either permanently or as a caretaker. 22 - The number of years between Sunderland's appearances in a major final. Poyet took them to the 2014 Capital One Cup final, 22 years on from their defeat to Liverpool in the FA Cup showpiece. They lost to Manchester City. 14 - Sunderland's final position in Poyet's first season. 4 - The amount of games won in the Premier League by Sunderland this season. The joint-worst with bottom side Leicester. Advocaat could land up to \u00a3500,000 if the Black Cats \u2013 currently one point above the relegation zone \u2013 avoid the drop. He will bring with him Montenegrin coach Zeljko Petrovic, who was Avram Grant's assistant at West Ham in 2010. It is unlikely, however, that Advocaat will be considered as the permanent successor to Gus Poyet, who was sacked yesterday after 17 months at the Stadium of Light. Sportsmail\u00a0understands that West Ham manager Sam Allardyce and Real Madrid assistant Paul Clement are at the top of the club's shortlist to take charge beyond this season. Clement, in particular, fits the profile of coach who could work within the structure at the club, where sporting director Lee Congerton has control over transfers. Clement and Congerton know each other from their time at Chelsea and the Real No 2 is thought to be keen to try his hand as a manager back in England. Meanwhile, it is Congerton's contacts book which has led to talks with Advocaat. Former Chelsea sporting director Frank Arnesen \u2013 who worked with Advocaat at PSV Eindhoven and Congerton at Stamford Bridge and then Hamburg \u2013 has recommended him for the role and he will be installed before Saturday's trip to West Ham. Advocaat could land up to \u00a3500,000 if the Black Cats \u2013  one point above the drop zone \u2013 avoid relegation . 'This is something I always wanted to do, the Premier League. The Premier League is a phenomenal competition,' Advocaat told AD Sportwereld. 'As a manager that is where you want to work, that has such a pulling power. 'Saturday, West Ham awaits. And then there's the international break. And then \u2013 the derby with Newcastle United. That is really something to look forward to because believe me, this just is a very big club.' Sunderland owner Ellis Short moved swiftly to dismiss Poyet during a telephone conversation after training on Monday. It is understood the Uruguayan asked for his contract \u2013 which expires in 2016 \u2013 to be paid up in full after he was informed that his position had become untenable. Zeljko Petrovic, who was Avram Grant's assistant at West Ham in 2010, will work alongside Advocaat . West Ham boss Sam Allardyce could be the long-term successor to Poyet at the Stadium of Light . His assistant Mauricio Taricco and first-team coach Charlie Oatway are also set to leave the club. Former Sunderland favourites and academy coaches Kevin Ball and Paul Bracewell will now be on hand to help at senior level. Short acted on the advice of the influential Congerton and chief executive Margaret Byrne in getting rid of Poyet. They felt there was no way back for the head coach following Saturday's 4-0 defeat at home to Aston Villa. Supporters tried to storm the dugout and also let their feelings be known to those seated in the directors' box. The decision was soon made to dispense with Poyet and contact initiated with Advocaat, who left his post as Serbia national team manager in November after just five months in charge. His first home game will be the visit of North-East rivals Newcastle on Easter Sunday.",

        "document": "(CNN)German investigators found antidepressants in the apartment of Germanwings co-pilot Andreas Lubitz this week, according to published reports. Die Welt, a German newspaper, cited an unidentified senior investigator who said Lubitz suffered from a severe \"psychosomatic illness\" and German police seized prescription drugs that treat the condition. Lubitz suffered from a \"severe subjective burnout syndrome\" and from severe depression, the source told Die Welt. The New York Times also reported that antidepressants were found during the search of his apartment. CNN has not been able to confirm the reports. Investigators continued to work Saturday to piece together the secret life of Lubitz, who officials say was hiding an illness from his employers. He had been declared \"unfit to work\" by a doctor. They were expected to question his relatives, friends and co-workers as they try to pin down what could have prompted the seemingly competent and stable co-pilot to steer a jetliner into a mountainside on Tuesday. As their efforts continued, dozens of people attended a remembrance ceremony for the victims of the crash at a church in a nearby town, Digne-les-Bains. There were 150 people on board Germanwings Flight 9525, including Lubitz. Relatives of the victims and local residents also gathered Saturday afternoon by a simple stone memorial set up near the crash site, in the village of Le Vernet. Flowers have been laid there, in the shadow of the snow-covered peaks of the French Alps. Much attention has focused on Lubitz's state of mind, with some media reports speculating that he may have had mental health issues. Investigators found a letter in the waste bin of his Dusseldorf, Germany, apartment saying that Lubitz, 27, wasn't fit to do his job, city prosecutor Christoph Kumpa said Friday. The note, Kumpa said, had been \"slashed.\" Just what was ailing Lubitz hasn't been revealed. The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, citing unnamed sources, reported Friday that Lubitz suffered from mental illness and kept his diagnosis concealed from his employer. A subsequent New York Times report on Saturday, citing two officials with knowledge of the investigation, said Lubitz sought treatment before the crash for vision problems that might have put his career at risk. According to those unnamed officials, Lubitz also was being treated for psychological issues. Other media reports indicate he was treated for depression. Lubitz passed his annual pilot recertification medical examination in summer 2014, a German aviation source told CNN. An official with Lufthansa, which owns Germanwings, said the exam only tests physical health, not psychological health, and that if Lubitz had vision problems that would have been discovered during the tests. \"We can't believe it. If anything was wrong with his eyes during the physical exam we would have known,\" the official says. The Lufthansa official also said the company was never given any indication Lubitz was depressed, and that if he went to a doctor on his own  he would have been required to self-report if he had been deemed unfit to fly. A Dusseldorf clinic said he'd gone there twice, most recently on March 10, \"concerning a diagnosis.\" But the University Clinic said it had not treated Lubitz for depression. German investigators said they still have interviews and other work to do before they can reveal what they gleaned from the records found in the apartment and at his parents' home in the town of Montabaur. But the fact that investigators found \"ripped, recent medical leave notes, including for the day of the offense, leads to the preliminary conclusion that the deceased kept his illness secret from his employer and his professional environment,\" prosecutors said. Germanwings corroborated that assertion, saying it had never received a sick note from Lubitz. Authorities left Lubitz's apartment Friday night with boxes of papers and evidence folders after spending about 90 minutes inside. Dusseldorf police said Saturday that a small team of French investigators had arrived in the city and that they were sharing information. Jean Pierre Michel, lead investigator for the French inquiry, told French TV from Dusseldorf that the French team would work in \"full transparency\" with their German counterparts. \"We will interview people related to the investigation in the coming days. The hearings will be conducted in the coming days and weeks,\" he said, according to CNN's French affiliate BFMTV. Asked by a journalist about reports of Lubitz's possible mental illness, he replied: \"The elements of the investigation are strictly confidential and we cannot address these matters today.\" No scenario can yet be ruled out, including mechanical failure, \"as we do not have the necessary evidence,\" he said. The German tabloid newspaper Bild said Saturday it had interviewed an ex-girlfriend of Lubitz. The woman is not named in the story and CNN has not been able to verify the report independently. According to Bild, the ex-girlfriend said Lubitz was a very nice and sensitive man who needed a lot of care and attention, and he was very troubled. She said he would get into fights with her. The newspaper also cited the ex-girlfriend as saying that Lubitz had bad dreams that his plane was going down. Patrick Sondenheimer was the pilot of Germanwings Flight 9525, according to Reiner Sondenheimer of Dusseldorf, Germany, who says he is a relative of Patrick's. Patrick Sondenheimer is the pilot believed to have been locked out of the cockpit by his co-pilot, Lubitz. CNN spoke to Reiner Sondenheimer at his Dusseldorf apartment. Also at the apartment was a woman who did not provide her name but said she was Patrick Sodenheimer's relative. That woman also said that Patrick Sondenheimer was on the doomed flight. Reiner Sondenheimer declined to say anything else, other than the family wanted time to grieve. The pilot has not been named by German authorities. Another Germanwings pilot who once flew with Lubitz, Frank Woiton, told WDR, a local broadcaster belonging to CNN's German affiliate ARD, that his impression of Lubitz was that he was \"friendly\" and that there was \"nothing suspicious.\" Woiton also said Lubitz \"was a good pilot and had a good command of the plane.\" Woiton's first job after he found out about the crash was the route Dusseldorf-Barcelona-Dusseldorf -- the same route as had been taken by Germanwings Flight 9525 a day earlier. He was praised in German media for the emotional announcement he made to passengers before takeoff, in which he said the crew, like everyone else on the plane, wanted to get home safely to their families. At the scene of the crash, two helicopters were being deployed above the mountainside by recovery crews Saturday. The weather has improved after high winds Friday made their complex task even more treacherous. Lt. Col. Xavier Vialenc, a spokesman for the Gendarmerie, told CNN there were about 40 officers at the crash site Saturday. Once at the crash site, recovery workers spend all day working there, he said. Back in Seyne-les-Alpes at the end of the day, they can see a psychologist if they choose and have a debriefing session with all the workers. Vialenc said the operations were going well so far and that the progress made was meeting their expectations. Yves Naffrechoux, captain of rescue operations at Seyne-les-Alpes, told CNN on Friday that rescuers have found bodies at the rugged crash site, but few of them are intact. It could be weeks before all the bodies are recovered, identified and released to the families, authorities said. What could have prompted Lubitz to deliberately destroy the aircraft, killing everyone on board, remains the focus of investigators in Germany. He had passed medical and psychological testing when he was hired in 2013, said Carsten Spohr, CEO of Lufthansa, which owns Germanwings. Spohr also told reporters that Lubitz had \"interrupted\" his pilot training, which he began in 2008. That break lasted several months, he said, but added that such an interruption isn't uncommon. Spohr didn't give a reason for the break. While the ailment Lubitz had sought treatment for hasn't been revealed, that he was declared unfit for work is an important detail, aviation analysts say. Pilots are required to maintain their fitness to fly and must tell their airline if they're found unfit, CNN aviation analyst David Soucie said. Who was co-pilot Andreas Lubitz? Although authorities have recovered the cockpit voice recorder, the flight data recorder remains missing. It could shed crucial details about what happened inside the cockpit, authorities say. Lubitz was the co-pilot on Tuesday's flight between Barcelona, Spain, and Dusseldorf when he apparently locked the captain out of the cockpit, then activated a control causing the plane to descend toward rugged terrain. Germanwings said the plane dropped for about eight minutes from its cruising altitude of 38,000 feet before crashing. The only sounds, authorities said, were those of pounding on the cockpit door, Lubitz's steady breathing and, eventually, screaming passengers. Lubitz and 149 other people on board the plane died in an instant, authorities say. Most were from Germany and Spain. Mother, daughter among 3 American victims . CNN's Pam Brown, Frederik Pleitgen, Mary Kay Mallonee, Michael Pearson, Nic Robertson, Margot Haddad, Stephanie Halasz, Sandrine Amiel, David Fitzpatrick, Felix Gussone, Karl Penhaul and Anna Maja Rappard contributed to this report.",

        "document": "Billionaire entrepreneur Richard Branson's Virgin Group may take on Tesla Motors and other companies in developing electric cars. Branson, whose empire ranges from airlines to music stores, mobile phones and spaceships, said electric cars may be next. 'We have teams of people working on electric cars,' Branson told Bloomberg TV in Miami where his Virgin Racing team competed in the all-electric Formula E race that involves battery-powered cars. Scroll down for video . Richard Branson runs a two car team in the Formula E contest - and hinted the firm may use the races to develop an electric car to take on Tesla. 'So you never know, you may find Virgin competing with the Tesla in the car business as we do in the space business. 'We will see what happens.' Branson's Virgin Galactic is a commercial spaceflight company that competes with SpaceX, which was founded by Tesla CEO Elon Musk. 'We are working with the Virgin Formula E team to develop the plan for next season's cars,' Virgin Group spokesman Nick Fox told Reuters. 'Our aim is to build a leading engine and car for next season. 'Maybe ultimately that could be used in the broader car market in the future.' In addition to Tesla, most of the world's automakers sell or are developing electric cars. The Virgin firm could take on Elon Musk's Tesla electric car firm, according to Branson. There are also signs Apple may be working on an electric car and Google is developing a car that can drive itself. However, broader acceptance of electric cars has been held back by the premium consumers must pay for the technology and fears about the driving range of an all-electric vehicle. Branson told Bloomberg TV, 'Tesla is as sexy as any other car on the road today.' The streets snaking through . downtown Miami's high rises will be buzzing this Saturday as . commuters make way for dart-shaped racing cars zooming by at . breakneck speeds - and little noise. The race drivers will be competing in the first Formula E . race in the United States since the all-electric series was . launched in Beijing in September 2014. Halfway through its inaugural season, Formula E has offered . the same, albeit quieter, thrills as the popular Formula One . events, with low-slung, opened-wheeled cars capable of speeds up . to 136 miles per hour (220 kilometers per hour). The Beijing race ended with a spectacular crash that sent . one of the $500,000 Renault SA cars flying. Danger and adrenaline are not all that you find on the . track, however. 'It's really something to see how racing has evolved to . fully electric motors. It could revolutionize racing and . transportation in general,' said Daniel Fernandez, 17, who . bought tickets with several high school friends to attend the . race, which is expected to attract more than 50,000 spectators. The series was launched by Jean Todt, a French racing icon . and former Ferrari chief executive who heads of the Federation . Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) that oversees Formula One. It is backed by environmentalist and actor Leonardo DiCaprio . and entrepreneur Richard Branson, whose Virgin Group sponsors a . two-car team. Developing a so-called green racing series has meant . overhauling how the races are run. Car batteries cannot be . charged mid-race, forcing drivers at some point to rush into a . second, fully charged car. The cars give off a high-pitched whistling sound, a bit like . a dentist's drill. Drivers also must carefully manage their power, a challenge . for race cars with a limited battery life. 'We have a target (power) consumption per lap and we need to . respect that like the Bible,' said Jaime Alguersuari, a . 24-year-old Spanish driver with Virgin. 'You want to win, but if . you burn up all your energy you won't finish.'",

        "document": "Hometown boy Jimmy Walker held his nerve to close out victory at the Valero Texas Open at TPC San Antonio. The Ryder Cup player added to his Sony Open title this season and three PGA Tour victories in 2014 as a closing 70 maintained his four-shot overnight lead. Jordan Spieth was second on seven under, having perhaps left his run too late before finishing with four birdies in the last five holes. Jimmy Walker poses with the Valero Texas Open trophy after recording a four-shot win . Walker took the trophy at his hometown tournament and now has six wins since the start of 2014 . Walker went into his final round with four-shot lead and managed to preserve his advantage . Walker birdied the par-five second when he laid up short of the green, pitched on and holed a straight eight-foot putt - though he gave the shot back at the fourth. Another bogey at the seventh was off-set as he pitched stone-dead from an awkward bunker stance at the next, and he birdied 10 as well before dropping a shot at 12. Playing partner Spieth made a late bid to exert some pressure with birdies at the 14th - via a 45-foot putt - and 15th and when his tee shot at the showpiece 16th spun back out of the fringe, there was scope for Walker to crack. Instead, the San Antonio resident struck a lovely pin-high tee shot and read the left-to-right break to perfection on the ensuing 16-foot putt. His birdie was matched by Spieth but the four-shot margin remained and despite a poor tee shot, Walker also birdied the penultimate hole with a good putt from 18 feet. Spieth did likewise and both parred the last to leave Walker as the tour's first repeat winner this season. He told NBC: 'It's at home and it's cool, you can feel support of friends, family and fans. It doesn't happen often, to win in your home town. 'It played hard today, sometimes it's hard to make pars. I wasn't putting very good but I finally got the putting stroke smoothed out and holed a couple. 'And Jordan... holy cow! I'll be having nightmares about that guy!' Spieth's efforts mean he has now finished in the top seven in eight of his last 10 starts. Walker, meanwhile, is building momentum for the Masters in two weeks' time and he said: 'I like Augusta. Walker adds the Valero Texas Open to the Sony Open title which he has already won this season . Jordan Spieth finished as runner-up, despite carding four birdies on the last five holes . Spieth said he found it hard to make par at times on the course but was Walker's closest challenger . 'All this keeps adding momentum and confidence and I'm excited to go. I'll head over tomorrow and take another look at it.' Billy Horschel, the third player in the group, finished third outright at four under. Chesson Hadley birdied the last hole to finish joint fourth with Daniel Summerhays at three under. Several players went into the tournament with hopes of breaking into the world's top 50 and qualifying for the Masters, but none were able to produce the finish they required.",

        "document": "Half of the terror attacks carried out or plotted in Britain involve members of just one extremist network, a new report reveals. Al-Muhajiroun, a banned organisation once fronted by hate preacher Anjem Choudary, has been linked to a series of atrocities and plots dating back to 1997. A new book by terrorism expert Raffaello Pantucci has now found that since its formation in the 1980s, the group has been central to Islamic extremism in the UK. More than 20 terror attacks plotted or carried out in the UK - including the 7/7 bombings which killed 52 people - have been linked to extremist network al-Muhajiroun in a new report . It is thought the first known violence directly linked to the group took place in 1997, when a member of the organisation attacked a police officer. At least one of the bombers who carried out London's 7/7 bombings had met a key supporter of al-Muhajiroun, Omar Khyam, before the attacks which killed 52 people on underground trains and a bus in 2005. Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale, who murdered Fusilier Lee Rigby in a street in Woolwich, south-east London in 2013, had both attended events organised by the group. Despite having been banned in 2005, the group has morphed to take on a series of other names, and its influence continues to be felt, with Brustholm Ziamani, who was sentenced last week for plotting an attack inspired by that on Lee Rigby, also having been inspired by al-Muhajiroun. Research shows that out of 51 attacks and plots carried out or foiled in Britain, al-Muhajiroun had influence in at least 23. Mr Pantucci, who studies extremism for defence forum The Royal United Services Institute, said the group sold its followers a radical interpretation of Islam which often inspired them to  commit violence. He told MailOnline: 'It is an oversimplification just to write them off as outcasts or losers, some of them have been involved in quite serious gang activity or crime in the past and end up finding this as a kind of redemption for their activity. 'You also have to remember that some of the top figures are quite charismatic people who are good at drawing people in and given them these very aggressive ideas.' Hate preacher Anjem Choudary (left) was once a leader of the group before it was banned. Supporter Omar Khyam (right) met up with at least one of the London bombers before they carried out the 2005 attack . Al-Muhajiroun was set up by Omar Bakri Mohammed (left), pictured with radical cleric Abu Hamzu (right) Mr Pantucci said that the group's influence had been underestimated in the past and hoped his book - whose title We Love Death As You Love Life is taken from quotation by one of the 7/7 bombers - would encourage politicians to crack down on the organisation and its spin-offs. He added: 'These people are very good at being in the periphery and the background without ever having their hands on the device or being directly implicated in plots, which would see them given heavier sentences. 'I think constant disruption of the group is not a bad thing. By proscribing these groups you force them to change their name, their website, which inhibits them, also by arresting them on more minor charges you take them off the streets for a time.' Al-Muhajiroun was set up by Omar Bakri Mohammed, a Syria-born Islamic extremist who lived in Britain from 1986 until he was banned from returning in 2005 after going to Lebanon. Anjem Choudary, who remains in Britain, later became the public face of the organisation, which re-emerged as groups called Islam4UK and Need4Khalafah after it was banned. Lee Rigby's killer, Michael Adebolajo (left) and Michael Adebowale (right), had attended the group's rallies . 2000: Mohammed Bilal, from bombing carries out Christmas Day suicide bombing in Kashmir. Then-al- Muhajiroun leader Bakri Mohammed says its possible he was 'one of their number'. 2002: US journalist was kidnapped and murdered in Pakistan. London-born Omar Saeed, a member of al- Muhajiroun, is later convicted over the plot and remains in prison in Pakistan. 2004: Five men, four of whom are thought to have been members of al-Muhajiroun, were caught by police while plotting to build a huge fertiliser bomb, which they dicussed setting off in the Bluewater shopping centre in Kent or the Ministry of Sound nightclub in London. Lee Rigby killer Michael Adebolajo (left) pictured with Anjem Choudary at a demonstration in 2007 . 2005: London 7/7 bombings killed 52. Al-Muhajiroun member Omar Khyam known to have contacted bomber Mohammed Siddique Khan before the attacks. 2006: Police foil 'liquid bomb' plot to take down an transatlantic airliner. Plotter Ahmed Abdullah Ali had known links to al-Muhajiroun. 2010: Plan to bomb the London Stock Exchange uncovered. Mohammed Chowdhury, one of four men convicted over the plot, had been an activist for al-Muhajiroun. 2013: Richard Dart, a Muslim convert who was a key member of al-Muhajiroun spin-off Muslims against Crusades, is jailed for plotting to attack soldiers in Royal Wotton Bassett. 2013: Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale, who had both attended al-Muhajiroun events, kill Fusilier Lee Rigby in Woolwich. 2015: Brusthom Ziamani jailed for planning a Lee Rigby-style attack. He became friends with al-Muhajiroun members after being kicked out of his parents' home.

Lisa Williams, 49, admitting hitting David Coleman, 54, three times in the head with the hammer after a long-running dispute between their two families about a fence. But she claimed she was acting in self-defence after Mr Coleman got into a fight with her brother and told the court she has 'learned  you don't knock people out with hammers'. The families had been 'neighbours at war' for eight years and Mr Coleman claimed the Williams would throw dog faeces into the garden and bang on walls at night to stop them sleeping. Lisa Williams, 49, (left) admitting hitting David Coleman, 54, (right) three times in the head with the hammer after a long-running dispute between their two families about a fence . Mr Coleman from Chingford, north-east London, also claimed Williams hated him because he looked like her ex-partner. A brawl erupted in June 2013 when Mr Coleman confronted Williams' brother Jonathan about mud smeared all over his front bay windows, Snaresbrook Crown court heard. Jonathan Williams was said to have got the upper hand in the fight and pinned Mr Coleman to the ground before his sister emerged from their house brandishing a hammer. A brawl erupted when Mr Coleman confronted Williams' brother about mud smeared on his windows, Snaresbrook Crown court (pictured) heard . Williams admitted striking Mr Coleman three times to the head with the hammer but claims she was acting in self-defence and\u00a0denied causing grievous bodily harm with intent. 'I hit him three times on the head with the hammer, the third time I used more [force] than I used for the first two, I wanted to knock him out, I wanted him to stop,' she said. When asked if she had stopped to think what type of injury a hammer blow would cause she said: 'No, I've since learned you don't knock people out with hammers - I thought he was going to kill us.' She claimed at one point in the fight Mr Coleman was straddling her, saying: 'I think I was concussed, it was so quick - I was concussed, I was woolly headed and what followed was as a result of being woolly headed. 'It was awful, I couldn't think straight, Jonathan was trying to release Mr Coleman's grip from him - he wouldn't let go and he kept flailing his legs out at my brother's legs.' 'I was horrified, it's like you're fighting for your life, it's like the whole world is caving in.' She claimed that she stopped when her brother managed to grab the hammer out of her hands. Other witnesses claim it was a third neighbour Bernard Mason, who ran from his home to break up the fight and disarm Williams. His wife Pamela Mason was forced to sit on her to restrain her until the police arrived, it has been claimed. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.",

        "document": "(CNN)When Longmont, Colorado, police officer Billy Sawyer responded to a 911 call from a pregnant woman who was stabbed and had her fetus ripped out, he wasn't prepared for what they would see. \"She was barely conscious. It was very hard to keep her attention at the moment,\" Sawyer told CNN's Erin Burnett. \" And she was covered in blood. It was one of the most horrific crime scenes I have seen.\" The officer grabbed a pair of gloves and tried to find where she was injured. Michelle Wilkins was weak and in shock when police arrived. Despite her shock, Wilkins was able to tell Sawyer that she had responded to a Craigslist ad and had been attacked. She didn't know at that moment that she had lost her child, but her ability to communicate the events helped save her own life. \"She's an amazing woman to have that will and that drive to survive and do what she did and be able to contact the police and tell us where she was at, where inside of that location she was at, and speak to me as I entered the residence, direct me to her location,\" Sawyer said. \"I mean, she is the only reason why she's alive right now.\" The grisly cutting of the fetus from Wilkins began when she responded to a Craigslist ad about baby clothes for sale. The 26-year-old Wilkins, who was seven months' pregnant, arrived at the seller's home Wednesday in Longmont. Stabbed in the stomach and bleeding, Wilkins called 911. Another officer, Phil Piotrowski, told CNN affiliate KDVR. that the scene was almost too much to bear. He had to take a moment to collect himself. \"When I walked in and looked at her for a short moment, I actually had to walk out for a second because my head wasn't able to wrap around it.\" Still, given what Wilkins had endured, it left him impressed. \"She is probably one of the strongest people I've ever had the pleasure to meet,\" Piotrowski said. Michelle Wilkins' uncle Chris Wilkins said, \"She's alive because professional first responders execute perfectly.\" But Piotrowski believes Wilkins is the one who \"saved her own life.\" The fetus died, but the mother survived and \"is improving minute by minute, hour by hour,\" according to Chris Wilkins. She's reported to be in critical but stable condition. Dynel Lane, 34, a former nurse aide, is being held on $2 million bail while prosecutors weigh charges against her, including murder. Lane is accused of stabbing Wilkins and removing a female fetus. The murder charge would reportedly depend on whether the fetus was old enough to have lived outside of her mother's body. In a statement obtained by KDVR, Michelle Wilkins' family says, \"We cannot begin to fathom the depths of depravity and evil which drove her attacker, and trust that between law enforcement and our legal system; they will make sure justice is carried out.\" CNN's John Fricke contributed to this report.",

        "document": "Labour and David Cameron's Tories remain neck and neck, despite the Conservatives being ahead in the polls . Tomorrow the Queen dissolves Parliament and the Election campaign begins. It will be the strangest Election of modern times and leaves the experts baffled. Most expected that, with economic recovery, and Cameron ahead of Miliband in the polls as favoured Prime Minister, the Tories would pull ahead. That has not happened. Labour and the Tories remain neck and neck. Only a fool, or a social scientist, would predict the outcome. The two major parties now attract a diminishing share of voters \u2013 about two in three in 2010 compared with more than 96 per cent in 1951. Voters have a wider choice than ever before. In England, they can opt for three other alternatives \u2013 not just the Lib Dems, but also Ukip and the Greens \u2013 all of whom score more than five per cent in the polls. In Scotland and Wales, there is a further alternative \u2013 the Nationalists. The weakening of the two party system makes a hung Parliament very likely. But, curiously, a small overall majority for the Tories or Labour could prove even more unstable than a hung parliament. The Tories would be at the mercy of their Eurosceptic Right wing, as John Major was in 1992. He had a majority of just 21, and used to say that he was at the mercy of 13 of them who were quite mad. They made his life a misery when he sought to ratify the Maastricht Treaty reforming the European Union. A Labour government with a small majority would be at the mercy of its Left wing which opposes austerity. Labour, contrary to Tory propaganda, is committed not to a splurge in public spending, but to public expenditure cuts, though less severe than Cameron and Osborne are proposing. But Labour austerity would disappoint the expectations of its supporters, many of whom look for rapid improvements in the NHS and social care. Speaking two weeks ago at the London School of Economics, Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP leader, advised English voters to support the Greens or what she called \u2018progressive\u2019 Labour candidates, that is candidates opposed to austerity. She hopes to create an anti-austerity bloc in the next Parliament, composed of the SNP, Greens and Left-wing Labour. That would cause problems for Miliband even if he won a majority. But, obviously, a hung parliament is more likely. The key question is whether it will lead to stable government, as it did in 2010. Many then thought, including myself, that the Conservative/Lib Dem coalition could not last. But it has, and with a comfortable majority of 78 in the Commons it has never really looked in danger of being brought down in Parliament. The danger in 2015 is that no majority coalition can be formed. Under our electoral system, Ukip and the Greens are unlikely to win many seats. That is why both support proportional representation. The SNP, which may well win many seats, will not deal with the Tories and will not join Labour in a coalition. If, as is likely, the Lib Dems lose seats then, even if they were prepared to enter another coalition, that might not be able to secure the 325 seats needed for a majority. This would mean that no two parties \u2013 other than the Tories and Labour \u2013 could command a majority. We would have a fragmented hung parliament. There would have to be a minority government. The last minority government following a General Election occurred in February 1974 after Ted Heath had gone to the country in the middle of a miners\u2019 strike asking the voters to decide \u2018Who Governs?\u2019 The voters, however, refused to give a clear answer and, in the fragmented hung parliament that followed, Labour governed as a minority for seven months. There was then a second General Election in October at which Labour won a small majority. Minority governments do not last long and, being dependent on bargaining with other parties, find it difficult to take long-term decisions. The longest-lasting was between 1929 and 1931, but that was buttressed for part of the time by a pact between Labour and the Liberals. Under our electoral system, Nigel Farage's Ukip and the Greens are unlikely to win many seats . In the past, the Prime Minister could try, as Labour did in 1974, to escape from the minority situation by dissolving Parliament. But the 2011 Fixed-Term Parliaments Act, providing for five-year parliaments, makes that option more difficult. Besides, there is no reason to believe a second General Election would, as in 1974, deliver a majority government. It could easily reproduce the same result. Why have we entered this messy period of multi-party politics, and will it prove more than a temporary condition? I believe it will, because it stems from a new social cleavage in British politics, a cleavage between those who have benefited from globalisation, from social and economic change, and those who have been left behind. The two major parties, together with the Lib Dems, represent the beneficiaries. Their leaders all believe Britain should stay in the EU. They all broadly welcome immigration. They all favour gay marriage. But many voters do not favour these things, and feel unrepresented by the mainstream parties. Alex Salmond (pictured) and Nicola Sturgeon are doing to Labour in Scotland what Nigel Farage is doing to the Tories in England . The typical Ukip supporter is not, as we used to think, Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells, a retired Army officer spluttering over his gin and tonic at the 19th hole, but a working-class voter or small businessman or shopkeeper who feels betrayed and belittled by the system. Blair\u2019s New Labour sought to win over graduates and middle-class professionals \u2013 those who aspired to leave the working class. Cameron\u2019s Conservatives sought to distance themselves from the image of the \u2018nasty party\u2019 by rejecting Thatcherism and embracing modernisation; while Cameron and Osborne, liberal-minded men, seem remote in lifestyle and understanding from those left behind. Ukip, in consequence, is now the most working-class party in English politics. The SNP in Scotland is different from Ukip in many respects. But it, too, represents the left behind. The vote in the independence referendum last September was a class vote. Labour areas in the west central belt around Glasgow voted \u2018Yes\u2019 to independence, while middle-class SNP areas in Perthshire and Aberdeenshire voted \u2018No\u2019. West Dunbartonshire, with nearly the lowest life expectancy in Scotland, voted \u2018Yes\u2019, East Dunbartonshire, with nearly the highest, voted \u2018No\u2019. Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon are doing to Labour in Scotland what Nigel Farage is doing to the Tories in England. The SNP could well be the third-largest party in the next Parliament, even though it will probably secure fewer votes than the Lib Dems, Ukip and the Greens. That will strain the Union to breaking point. In England, Cameron says if you vote for Farage you will get Miliband. In Scotland, Miliband says if you vote SNP, you will get Cameron. But, to the left behind, Cameron and Miliband are equivalent \u2013 members of an Oxbridge liberal elite who represent the exam-passing classes who do not understand the aspirations of the less fortunate. That is why the multi-party system is here to stay and why we are about to enter an era of political instability. Anyone seeking a quiet life should go abroad for the next six weeks.",

        "document": "Former U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. will be released from a federal prison on Thursday and will serve out the remainder of his term in a Washington, D.C., halfway house, former U.S. Rep. Patrick Kennedy told The Associated Press after visiting Jackson behind bars. Kennedy said he spoke with Jackson at the minimum security federal prison camp in Montgomery, Alabama, where the son of the civil rights leader has been serving a 2 \u00bd-year sentence after pleading guilty to illegally spending $750,000 in campaign funds on more than 3,000 personal items. The expenditures included fur capes, lavish interior decorations for his home and rock music memorabilia. Jackson's plea deal was arranged just two days after he was re-elected to represent his Illinois congressional district. At the time Republicans cried foul, noting that they would have had a chance to win hsi seat if news had emerged before Election Day. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Former Illinois Rep Jesse Jackson Jr and his wife, Sandra, were both convicted of federal crimes in a scheme that involved spending mroe than $750,000 of his campaign money on more than 3,000 personal items . BIG HOUSE: Jackson sered his time at the Butner Federal Correctional Complex outside of Raleigh, North Carolina \u2013 the same prison where investment fraudster Bernie Madoff is incarcerated . Jackson Jr.'s father, Rev. Jesse Jackson (left) and his wife Jacqueline Lavinia Brown (right) attended court sessions in 2013 and were present for their son's sentencing . Jackson began the sentence on Nov. 1, 2013. The Bureau of Prisons lists his final release date as Sept. 20, 2015. The disgraced lawmaker's crime was officially described as wire and mail fraud, catch-all federal criminal categories frequently used as placeholders for financial corruption. His wife, Sandra, was also sentenced to a year in prison in connection with the corruption scheme. She pleaded guilty to a single charge of filing a false tax return in an attempt to hide the fraud. Court documents showed that Sandra, a Chicago city councilwoman when she was charged, had spent her husband's campaign funds on vacations, electronics and furs. She was ordered to pay $22,000 in restitution, in addition to the $750,000 her husband had to pay back. The U.S. Marshals Service seized all the items purchased illegally and auctioned everything to repay what they stole. Also sold was their richly decorated Washington, D.C. townhouse. The haul included one of the late singer Michael Jackson's fedoras and a guitar reportedly signed by both Michael Jackson and rock star Eddie Van Halen. In an unusual arrangement, a federal judge allowed Mrs. Jackson to avoid reporting to prison until her husband's release so that their children would not lose both parents at once. She will likely begin serving her sentence in September. Jesse Jackson Jr. sold his Washington, D.C. town house (pictured) to help pay a $750,000 forfeiture he owed after his guilty plea . The US Marshals Service auctioned off some of the Jacksons' ill-gotten goods \u2013 including these two furs . Kennedy said he was in the area giving a speech on children's mental health and decided to visit Jackson on Monday. 'You can imagine my surprise when I'm there, and I'm talking to him, and he says, \"I'm leaving Thursday morning\",' Kennedy said. He said Jackson, 50, told him he would be picked up from prison by his wife, Sandra; his two children; his father, the Rev. Jesse Jackson; and his mother, Jacqueline Jackson. His family will then take him to the halfway house. 'He said he'd have to report with his probation officer and he'd have to get some kind of job and start to put his life back together,' Kennedy said. Kennedy said he had not seen Jackson since August 2012, when he visited him at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota after Jackson took a leave from Congress and checked himself in for bipolar disorder. Kennedy has been an outspoken advocate on mental health issues. The two men served as Democrats in Congress together, and both have famous fathers. Kennedy's father was the late Sen. Edward Kennedy. SUMPTUOUS: Jackson's Washington, DC house got a decorator's touch, courtesy of his campaign donors . Among the items auctioned by the US Marshals Service was this framed and autographed cymbal from Michael Jackson's last concert tour . Bureau of Prisons spokesman Edmond Ross said he could not confirm that Jackson would be released to a halfway house, saying the bureau does not consider such plans public information. The Rev. Jesse Jackson directed inquiries to the Bureau of Prisons. He confirmed that Kennedy had met with his son. Messages left for attorneys for Jackson Jr. were not immediately returned. Kennedy said Jackson's mental health is much better than the last time he saw him at the Mayo Clinic. Kennedy said Jackson had even put a positive spin on his time in prison, saying it had allowed him to 'unplug' from the world. 'He's a lot more at ease with his role and responsibility with what got him into jail,' Kennedy said. He added that Jackson 'feels he's done his time.' Kennedy said they also talked about what's next. 'He's also very excited about what lies ahead for him in the future, which I think is very hopeful,' he said.",

        "document": "A Qatar Airways employee has been shamed by airline boss Rossen Dimitrov after he emailed a photo of her slumped on the floor, apparently drunk, to the entire workforce. The photo shows a woman laid on the floor outside her staff accommodation, allegedly sleeping off a drinking session. The Qatar Airways vice president used the opportunity to tell staff how 'disappointed' he was in the cabin crew member's behaviour in a mass email sent to staff. The Qatar Airways staff member was pictured slumped in a doorway after allegedly returning back drunk . The email sent out by Qatar Airways boss Rossen Dimitrov after he came across a photo of a drunk member of staff . In the email, revealed to the Daily Star, Mr Dimitrov wrote: 'I am so ashamed and disturbed by this behaviour displayed by a tenured member of our team, an adult who has been with the company for over 9 years. 'How can we change rules when we do not behave as mature individuals. I am very disappointed.' Qatar Airways - which employs over 31,000 people, is the world's tenth largest airline with a modern fleet of over 100 aircraft. It is also one of the fastest-growing airlines in the world, investing in both the double-decker Airbus A380 planes as well as the ultra-modern A350 XWB, which was unveiled in December last year. The airline has high expectation of staff, particularly as it operates out of the Muslim country, which does not allow the consumption of alcohol among Qatari citizens. Library photo shows a Qatar air stewardess working on board an aircraft. She is not the same stewardess pictured in the photograph above . Qatar Airways told MailOnline Travel the email was sent to remind staff how they need to respect Qatari customs. A spokesperson said: 'The email was sent to impress on our cabin crew that, to make their working environment as good as it can be, while still respecting the norms and values of the Qatari society in which we work, everyone has a part to play. 'In Doha, the consumption of alcohol is not permitted for nationals and, although drinking is permitted for foreigners, being seen to be drunk would be considered highly disrespectful \u2013 it would have negative implications for both the individual and those associated with them.' Qatar Airways employs over 31,000 people, and has high standards of its workforce . The spokesperson added: 'In this particular case, the individual concerned was found in a state of incapacity by the entrance of a Qatar Airways staff building. 'The vast majority of our cabin crew would themselves be disappointed at the idea that one of their colleagues should get into this situation, since they share our pride in the reputation of our team, and they would also, as we are, be very concerned about the safety implications for someone in this position.' Referring to Mr Dimitrov's comment in the email about 'changing the rules', the airline commented: 'For over a year we have been working on a review and revision of the employment conditions for our cabin crew members, leading to reforms in our practices that have been universally welcomed by our staff as we have rolled them out since December 2014. 'This is something of which we are proud, but obviously we are making these changes in a culture which remains largely conservative. We think that the cabin crew community has an important part to play in showing that we have done the right thing in making these reforms, which is why we wanted to move quickly to highlight the kind of problems that could be caused by behaviour which offends local culture. The spokesperson continued: 'The matter is now under investigation, and we shall not be commenting further.'",

        "document": "They like Manchester band The Courteeners at Old Trafford. Upon winning their 20th Premier League title fans had the words of their song 'Not Nineteen Forever' made into a banner that takes pride of place at the Theatre of Dreams. But in the case of forgotten man Ander Herrera and his triumphant return to the side, the Middleton four-piece's earlier hit 'What Took You So Long?' would be more appropriate. Ander Herrera (centre) is starting to make an impact for Louis van Gaal's Manchester United side . Herrera has forged a strong bond with fellow Spaniard Juan Mata, who scored twice against Liverpool . What took you so long Louis van Gaal? Why was Herrera, suddenly a key player in United's new-found swagger, out of the picture for long chunks of the season? There is more than one answer. Firstly, if anyone is a 'club signing' it is Herrera. Long before the coronation of King Louis, United originally vowed to ensure he would be their man following his mesmerising role in Athletic Bilbao' 2011-12 Europa League victory over Sir Alex Ferguson's side. The admiration from within spread to the stands. They have never been shy of praising opponents at Old Trafford \u2013 this was where, in 2003, Ronaldo famously secured a standing ovation after a beautiful Champions League hat-trick for Real Madrid. The 25-year-old was signed from Athletic Bilbao in a \u00a328.8million move following Van Gaal's arrival . Herrera made a bright start to his United career, but injury saw the Spaniard sidelined for several weeks . In that frantic and ultimately fruitless first summer David Moyes famously made one attempt to capture Herrera's services which ended in confusion after the complex hurdles within the player's contract could not be overcome. But they would not give up. When Van Gaal arrived talks were at an advanced stage with Herrera's representatives and he was happy to give the \u00a328.8m move the green light with the new season approaching. United have paid more for only four others, but as we have heard more than once, under Van Gaal's philosophy the fee counts for nothing. Former United boss David Moyes made an attempt to capture Herrera's services, but failed . The Spanish midfielder is having to prove his worth to Van Gaal during his first season at Old Trafford . Herrera celebrates scoring during United's FA Cup fifth round victory against Preston in February . Not being the Dutchman's player, Herrera may have had to prove himself more than most. In a stuttering start to the season, he was not seen for a month after being substituted at half-time against West Bromwich Albion. As late as February he had completed 90 minutes just once since the 5-3 humbling at Leicester City in September. With their team struggling for rhythm United fans who remembered Herrera conducting the tune for Bilbao, scratched their heads at his continued absence. When he made a rare start in the 3-1 FA Cup win at Deepdale on February 16 many put it down to Van Gaal's squad rotation. Herrera's partnership with Daley Blind (right) has added tempo to what looked like a static midfield . But Herrera has started every game since, the kickstarting of his Old Trafford career coinciding with United finally clicking into gear. His partnership with Daley Blind has added tempo to what looked like a static midfield. Suddenly United appear as sharp as their 1980s shirt sponsors. Herrera's through ball for Juan Mata to open the scoring against Liverpool came in a dominant half of football United fans wondered if they would ever see again only weeks ago. But there is more to it than Herrera simply not being the boss's signing. In a wide-ranging interview with El Pais, he offered more clues. Herrera and Mata chase down Philippe Coutinho during United's 2-1 victory against Liverpool on Sunday . Mata puts the ball past Simon Mignolet for his firs goal following a brilliant throughball from Herrera . 'Van Gaal loves possession and doesn't like to risk [losing] the ball,' he said. 'He wants long possessions and to keep the ball because he believes you create spaces staying in the right place, because the team have the quality to find you. 'At the beginning he used to tell me off because I always looked for the ball, I wanted to have it, and I must wait for it.' Van Gaal is on the record stating his belief that his players must not play off the cuff \u2013 that they should know their jobs and if they do them his side will win. Michael Carrick (left) congratulates Herrera on the part he played in Mata's opening goal . It is a pragmatic cross-sports philosophy used in the NFL by New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick, whose team this year won their fourth Super Bowl this century. While it does not sound like the famous United Way, it certainly looked like it at Anfield. Herrera, superb on Merseyside, believes that if it had not been for football he would have tried a career in sports journalism. By the looks of things, he has plenty of new chapters to write at Old Trafford first.",

        "document": "Islamic State supporters have taken to social media to boast about the recruitment of a failed party loving rapper from Tunisia. Maurouane Douiri, better known by his stage name Emino, announced his decision to join ISIS by posting a picture of himself holding a goat, allegedly in Iraq. Emino appears to have abandoned his trademark ushanka hat and is shown wearing a long red and white Arab scarf. Scroll down for video . Militant:\u00a0Maurouane Douiri, better known by his stage name Emino, announced his decision to join ISIS by posting a picture of himself holding a goat, allegedly in Iraq . His earlier life: Emino (pictured left) was previously one of a dozen Tunisian rappers who were vocal critics of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali's regime . Sudden change: Having previously used his social media page to proudly show off his body,\u00a0Emino's most recent photograph (left) was captioned with a declaration of allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi . Strangely posed holding a small brown and white goat, the once wannabe gangster wrote that he had given his allegiance to the leader of Islamic State, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Emino was one of a dozen Tunisian rappers who were vocal critics of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali's regime. Previously the 25 year old used his social media page to proudly show off photos of himself surrounded with a bevy of scantily clad ladies. One of the photos shows the rapper being touched and stroked by a group of women, with one of them appears to be drinking from a suspicious looking wine glass. Emino is no trendsetter - at least three other failed rappers have joined ISIS over the last few years. German rapper Denis Cuspert is the best known of the three known rappers to have been part of Islamic State . Radical: Known on stage as Deso Dogg, the wannabe gangster (left) traded in his failing career to embrace the extremist group's radical brand of Islam . Rapping jihadis: Emino is no trendsetter - at least three other failed rappers - including Germany's Deso Gogg (left) and America's Douglas McAuthur McCain (right) \u00a0have joined ISIS in recent years . German rapper Denis Cuspert is the best known of the three known rappers to have been part of Islamic State. Known on stage as Deso Dogg, the wannabe gangster traded in his failing career to embrace the extremist group's radical brand of Islam. American failed rapper Douglas McAuthur McCain was reportedly killed fighting for ISIS last August. McCain, who enjoyed smoking marijuana in the park and had previous convictions for disorderly conduct, is thought to have converted to Islam in 2004. After travelling to Istanbul, McCain crossed the border and entered Syria sometime in June 2014. The 33-year-old was killed whilst fighting against the Free Syrian Army in late August . His body was identified by his distinctive neck tattoo, a hallmark of his wilder days in Minnesota. Tunisia has long been a hot-bed of would be jihadist sympathetic to the ISIS cause, with an estimated 3,000 people fighting in Syria \u2013 the highest number of any country. The north African country has always been a breeding ground for terrorists, with extremists advantage of bored and jobless young men looking for an escape route. But the recent surge in numbers seems to be down to the hard-line groups which have taken advantage of the relaxing laws following the Jasmine Revolution in 2011 - including Islamist militant group Ansar al Sharia, which the United States brands as a terrorist organisation and blames for a 2012 attack on the U.S. embassy in Tunis. The government also released a number of fundamentalists from prison \u2013 allowing them to mix freely with the population once more. These groups have taken advantage of the declining economy, capitalising on the disappointment felt by those who expected a change after the Arab Spring, according to Imen Triki, a lawyer who represents returning jihadists. \u2018The Arab revolutions raised an expectation that wasn't met \u2013 people thought their lives would improve, but instead they got worse,\u201d Mr Triki told The Telegraph. \u2018In Syria, they are told they\u2019ll get houses, they\u2019ll get wives. These people are so alienated from our society that some choose this option in a heartbeat.\u2019 Social media is also blamed, with pictures of ISIS fighters getting thousands of likes and recruiters using Facebook to find any potential fighters, much like is seen in the UK. But with the rise of ISIS in Libya, to the east, and al-Qaeda affiliated groups in Algeria, to the west, it is now easy to join a \u2018jihad\u2019, and get arms into Tunisia itself. \u2018Tunisia is surrounded by jihadist groups in the mountains who coordinate with the terrorists in Libya ... Libya is the main source of arms for jihadists in Tunisia,\u2019 said Prime Minister Mehdi Jomaa. But despite this, Tunisia is seen as the success story of the Arab Spring, and tourist numbers have been on the increase once more as people begin to feel the area is safe once more. In 2013, 6.27million people visited Tunisia. Of those, almost 330,000 were British, while 985,000 were French.",

        "document": "Detectives investigating claims of a VIP paedophile sex ring have been passed lurid allegations relating to Enoch Powell. The late Tory MP, who was one of the most prominent and divisive politicians of the 20th century, was named in a Church of England review into historic sex abuse. The claims relate to allegations of satanic rituals, often involving the abuse of children. Scroll down for video . Allegation:\u00a0Detectives investigating claims of a VIP paedophile sex ring have been passed lurid allegations relating to Enoch Powell, above . Powell is one of several high-profile names passed to Scotland Yard by Bishop of Durham Paul Butler, who is leading the review. The Bishop has also handed detectives the name of Leo Abse, the flamboyant Welsh MP who died in 2008 aged 91. Last night the Church of England confirmed that both names had been passed on to detectives from Operation Fernbridge, a Metropolitan Police inquiry into an alleged Westminster VIP paedophile network. The Right Rev Butler was given the politicians\u2019 names by Dominic Walker, former Bishop of Monmouth, who heard the allegations when he was a vicar counselling in the 1980s. Mr Walker told senior clerics that Abse was named by three abuse survivors whom he counselled when he was a vicar in Brighton in the 1980s. He also passed on the names of two former Conservative cabinet ministers, who have not yet been publicly linked to the scandal. Mr Walker was questioned by the Right Rev Butler after the discovery of a book from 1991 in which he described counselling sessions with adult survivors. Powell is one of several high-profile names passed to Scotland Yard by Bishop of Durham Paul Butler, above, who is leading the review . \u2018A number of survivors independently gave the name of a particular MP being involved,\u2019 he said, adding. \u2018I don\u2019t believe there was any collusion in their stories.\u2019 A Church of England spokesman said: \u2018The name Enoch Powell was passed to Operation Fernbridge on the instruction of Bishop Paul Butler.\u2019 In 1994, an investigation by the London School of Economics into 84 alleged cases of \u2018satanic abuse\u2019 in the UK between 1987 and 1992 found no convincing corroborative evidence. The claims against Powell and Abse have emerged amid mounting claims of a paedophile network involving Establishment figures, which was allegedly covered up by Special Branch. Police are to be given access to secret files held on MPs in the House of Commons archives to help their search for evidence on suspected abusers, including former Liberal MP Cyril Smith. Enoch Powell\u2019s frontline political career ended in 1968 after he made his \u2018rivers of blood\u2019 speech warning about the dangers of uncontrolled immigration. Tory leader Edward Heath sacked him from the shadow cabinet the following day, although Powell remained a Tory MP until 1974. SIMON HEFFER: Monstrous slur against my friend . Four years before he died in 1998, Enoch Powell did me the honour of asking me to write his biography. I spoke to almost everyone alive who knew him. When he died, I had unique access to a vast collection of private papers, including numerous intimate letters. If there is anyone alive other than Enoch\u2019s widow and daughters who knows more about him than I do, I\u2019d like to meet him. I never detected the slightest whiff of scandal about Powell, writes Simon Heffer . I never detected the slightest whiff of scandal about Powell. His probity in personal and financial matters was rock solid. When on Saturday evening a fellow journalist told me of the allegations made by the Church of England, my first instinct was to laugh: but that soon changed into utter outrage when I realised he was serious. The Church has publicly accused Enoch of being involved in ritual satanic abuse on hearsay, without the slightest evidence. They might as well accuse him of having been a war criminal or an armed robber, for there would be as much truth in either allegation. The appalling slurs are just like those made against 91-year-old Lord Bramall, a D-Day veteran and former chief of defence staff, whose homes in London and North Yorkshire were gratuitously raided by police recently on the back of an unspecified allegation of a sexual nature dating back to the 1970s. It is not just that the bishops who have made these accusations are behaving in a remarkably un-Christian fashion by putting this smear into the public domain. But that they do not appear even to have engaged what passes for their brains, or consciences, before behaving in this grotesque and offensive fashion. Their brains should have told them that a man of Enoch\u2019s controversial reputation would never for a moment have got away with the type of behaviour they are alleging he indulged in during the 1980s. The Establishment turned against Enoch in 1968 after the so-called Rivers of Blood speech; it would never have protected him for a second had it detected the slightest whiff of scandal. Their consciences should have told them that to make such an outrageous allegation about an enormously distinguished public figure who cannot defend himself, and which would cause the deepest distress to his family and friends, was the height of mischief and irresponsibility. It is disgraceful and destabilising for clergy to behave in this way, and the Church needs to investigate those responsible for this smear and take action accordingly. These post-Savile accusations bring to mind the hysteria surrounding allegations of satanic abuse in the late 1980s and early 1990s, including notorious cases in Rochdale and the Orkneys that involved social workers and police forcibly removing children from their homes in dawn raids. When the London School of Economics investigated 84 alleged cases, it found no convincing corroborative evidence of any abuse \u2013 yet families had been torn apart on the say-so of those who insisted action be taken. Enoch Powell, pictured making a speech in 1977, has been named\u00a0in a Church of England review into historic sex abuse . For decades, Enoch Powell has long been a bug-bear of the liberal Establishment. He has been demonised not least because to attack his memory is a quick and effective way for them to score points by setting out their own political correctness. What better way for some mischievous Leftist priest to damage Enoch further than by linking him with the current rash of stories about child abuse? In 1998, just after Enoch died, the BBC broadcast a programme in which they railed at Enoch for his hypocrisy. They said this scourge of mass immigration had visited the West Indies in 1953 to recruit black labour for the NHS. I was told of the story before the programme was broadcast and informed its researcher that Enoch had never been to the West Indies in his life. I was told, effectively, that I was lying, and it was broadcast. A black clergywoman, then resident in London, talked at length of Enoch having recruited her as a nurse. The story was rubbish. Detailed investigation by the BBC complaints department found that the woman had been recruited after a visit to her island by Jack Profumo, not Enoch Powell at all, and the Corporation was forced to make a grovelling on-air apology in peak time. I have long dreamt of the day when ignorant politicians and Establishment figures would stop manipulating Enoch\u2019s memory for their own advantage. But I never thought I would hear of bishops of the Church of England doing it. The allegations are a monstrous lie. That the lie appears to have been retailed by a priest is beyond contempt. There must be an investigation and, for all the distress this outrage has caused, there must be a reckoning.",

Calvo, 37, was a U.S. citizen who lived with his wife and children in Barcelona, where he worked in real estate for Spanish design firm Desigual. A frequent traveler, he was embarking on a business trip to Dusseldorf with Spanish colleague\u00a0Laura Altamira when he boarded the doomed Airbus A320 on Tuesday. The two other U.S. citizens among the 150 victims on the flight operated by Lufthansa's budget carrier were named yesterday as\u00a0Booz Allen Hamilton contractor Yvonne Selke and her daughter, Emily. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Tragic: Married father Robert Oliver Calvo, 37, was the third American to die in the Germanwings crash . Calvo, who lived in Barcelona, worked for design firm Desigual and was traveling to Dusseldorf for work . According to Calvo's Facebook page, he was born in Rub\u00ed, in northeastern Spain. He had two children, according to the New York Daily News. His American father told\u00a0Reuters television\u00a0on Thursday that he and his wife had been following the investigation into Tuesday's crash from their home in Spain. 'Some people feel better getting closer to where their loved ones might be,' said Robert Tansill Oliver, a 73-year-old retired English teacher who has lived in Barcelona since 1966. 'But in this case, we would like to go when something can be identified, one of their belongings can be identified, then of course we would like to go. But for the moment we prefer to be with our grandchildren and with the wife of our son to comfort them and be alongside them.' Remember the good things: His American father, Robert Transill Oliver, urges grieving families not to think about the last 10 seconds of their loved ones' lives but to think of the moments they had together . Horrific: 150 people died when the Airbus A320 crashed into a mountain in the French Alps on Tuesday . Victim: Emily Selke, a recent Drexel University graduate, died alongside her mother Yvonne on the flight . The co-pilot of the Airbus A320 deliberately crashed the plane, a French prosecutor said on Thursday, and German police searched his home for clues to his reasons. But prosecutor Brice Robin said 28-year-old Andreas Lubitz's act should not be called a suicide because it killed so many other people. Robert Tansill Oliver urged the families who lost loved ones not to dwell on the final minutes of the fatal flight. 'I'd like to encourage them to think about the wonderful years that they have enjoyed of life together ... Think about the good moments, the wonderful moments, and, of course, think about the future,' he said. State Department spokesman Jeff Rathke said: 'We are continuing to review our records to determine whether any other U.S. citizens might have been on board the flight.' Troubled: Questions have been raised asking why Andreas Lubitz got permission to fly after evidence of mental issues and distress. He locked the captain out of the cockpit and steadily drove the plane to crash .",

That's why the Australian-born pop star is in Austin, Texas, this week, where he will be performing at a United Nations/MixRadio brunch at the SXSW festival. Simpson, 18, is the spokesman for the #HappySoundsLike playlist, promoting the U.N.'s International Day of Happiness on Friday, March 20. The singer and other celebs selected tracks for the playlist. \"There is honestly nothing I can think of that I like to do more than make other people happy through live music,\" said Simpson, who will perform a few acoustic tracks at the SXSW brunch. The International Day of Happiness is a global celebration that came about after the U.N. General Assembly adopted a resolution in 2011 recognizing happiness as a \"fundamental human goal.\" The observation was decreed in 2012 after the first  U.N. conference on happiness, and the first Day of Happiness was held on March 20, 2013. Simpson said it makes sense to have music as such an important part of the day. \"I want to be able to share a message of happiness,\" the singer said. \"I think music is such an escape for people.\" He selected Bob Marley's \"Three Little Birds\" for the playlist. Britney Spears selected Prince's \"Kiss,\" and Pharrell picked Talking Heads' \"This Must Be the Place.\" Ed Sheeran, David Guetta, Charlize Theron, John Legend and James Blunt are also among those taking part. Simpson recently released a cover of Marley's \"No Woman No Cry\" and said the legendary reggae artist is a personal inspiration. \"The majority of music today has no substance,\" said Simpson, who is an independent artist. \"You want to be able to feel something true.\" As for what makes Simpson the happiest (other than music, of course), he said it's the simple things like relaxing with his family and just slowing down. \"Happiness is kind of taken from you if your mind is too busy,\" he said. \"Be present in that moment.\" Fans are being encouraged to post the song that makes them the happiest using the social media hashtag #HappySoundsLike.",

        "document": "An asteroid so large it has the potential to cause widespread devastation is on its way towards Earth. But despite   being called a \u2018Potentially Hazardous Asteroid\u2019 (PHA) by Nasa, experts are telling people not to be worried. The huge rock, called 2014 YB35, will sail past the planet tomorrow morning at a distance so large it it is\u00a011.7 times further than the distance between Earth and the moon. Scroll down for video . Asteroid 2014 YB35 will pass 2.8 million miles from Earth tomorrow (artist's impression shown). It was discovered by the Catalina Sky Survey at the University of Arizona. The asteroid is estimated to be 1,640ft-wider (500 metres) which would be large enough to cause devastation - but it will not hit Earth . And while this event will occur without incident, the experts added it is a reminder of how many dangerous space rocks there are in our planet\u2019s vicinity. The asteroid is estimated to be about 1,640ft (500 metres) wide which, if it hit Earth, would be large enough to cause widespread devastation - although there is no chance of this happening. However, it is estimated that there are about 25,000 near-Earth objects (NEOs) larger than 460ft (140 metres), bodies that come close to Earth but don't necessarily hit our planet. And there are also an estimated 1,000 NEOs larger than 3,280ft (one kilometre), highlighting the need to keep track of these space rocks. On average, Earth is hit by a football pitch-sized rock every 5,000 years, and a civilisation-ending asteroid every one million years, according to Nasa's Near-Earth Object Program. Last year, the privately-funded B612 Foundation discovered that Earth is up to 10 times more likely to be hit than previously thought. While the majority of the impacts occur either high up in the atmosphere, or in unpopulated areas including the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, the danger was still ever-present. The findings were based on information released from the Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organisation. This operates a network of sensors that monitor Earth around the clock listening for the infrasound signatures of nuclear detonations. But what these sensors found were not nuclear explosions, but rather asteroid impacts on a huge scale. Between 2000 and 2013 the network detected 26 explosions on Earth ranging in energy from one to 600 kilotons - all caused by asteroid impacts. Relative to Earth, asteroid 2014 YB35 is travelling at 23,000 mph (37,000 km/h), and its closest approach tomorrow will be 2,779,956 miles (4,473,907km). It was first discovered by the Catalina Sky Survey at the University of Arizona in December 2014, and will make an even closer, but still safe, approach in 2033 - 2,069,166 miles (3,330,000km). Nasa lists 2014 YB35 as a \u2018Potentially Hazardous Asteroid\u2019 (PHA) but, as yet, there is no chance of an impact scheduled for any point in future. \u2018This \u201cpotential\u201d to make close Earth approaches does not mean a PHA will impact the Earth,\u2019 said Nasa. \u2018It only means there is a possibility for such a threat. 'By monitoring these PHAs and updating their orbits as new observations become available, we can better predict the close-approach statistics and thus their Earth-impact threat.\u2019 But speaking to the Express, Dr Bill Napier, professor of astronomy at the University of Buckinghamshire, warned there was a \u2018very real risk\u2019 of an object hitting Earth at some point in the future. \u2018With something like YB35, we are looking at a scale of global destruction, something that would pose a risk to the continuation of the planet,\u2019 he said. \u2018These events are however very rare, it is the smaller yet still very damaging impacts which are a very real threat.\u2019 Shown is the path of asteroid\u00a02014 YB35 tomorrow. A;though it looks like it will come extremely close to Earth, it will actually pass very safely at a distance of 0.03 AU. A single Astronomical Unit - AU - is the distance from Earth to the sun Credit: Nasa . Last year experts warned that we must do more to track asteroids, as one could cause widespread damage to the planet.\u00a0Most notably, in February 2013, hundreds of people were injured when a meteor exploded near the city of Chelyabinsk in Russia - the largest recorded meteor strike in more than a century . In the past year, a host of famous science names have joined forces to warn the world of the threat posed to Earth by asteroids. In December, more than 100 leading scientists and astronauts from Dr Brian May to Chris Hadfield signed a declaration asking for increased action to tackle objects that could end life on Earth. The experts called for a 100-fold increase in the detection and monitoring of so-called near Earth objects (NEOs). It is estimated that of the million or so asteroids that could cause major damage on Earth, we are aware of only about 10,000 - or one per cent. This means that at any moment an asteroid could enter the atmosphere and cause widespread destruction, without any prior knowledge. The possibility of this scenario has been repeatedly hinted at recently by meteorites and fireballs spotted in the sky. Yesterday Nasa released details of its Asteroid Redirect Mission (illustrated), which will see astronauts study an asteroid in space next decade.\u00a0The mission is estimated to cost about \u00a3840 million ($1.25 billion), not including launch costs, and is targeted for liftoff in December 2020 . Most notably, in February 2013 hundreds of people were injured when a meteor exploded near the city of Chelyabinsk in Russia, the largest recorded meteor strike in more than a century. And in 1908, a comet exploded over the upper atmosphere in the sparse region of Tunguska, Siberia, devastating an area about the size of a major metropolitan region \u2013 800 square miles (2,000 square km). \u2018The more we learn about asteroid impacts, the clearer it becomes that the human race has been living on borrowed time,\u2019 Dr Brian May said in a statement in December. \u2018We are currently aware of less than one per cent of objects comparable to the one that impacted at Tunguska, and nobody knows when the next big one will hit. \u2018It takes just one.\u2019",

        "document": "Sharron O'Neill always knew she had something. Even before she was diagnosed with cancer as a teenager, she knew her family had a stronger link to the deadly disease than others. When Ms O'Neill was diagnosed with Lynch syndrome in her late 20s, a genetic condition that makes someone more likely to get cancer, she said it wasn't surprise. Sharron O'Neil and her mother, Jilian Carter, both have Lynch syndrome. It is a genetic condition that makes someone 85 per cent more likely to get cancer . 'Our family always knew there was something; we just didn't know it was a gene and a specific thing,' Ms O'Neill said. 'But, once I found out about Lynch syndrome and knew what it was, it all started to make sense.' Mrs O'Neill was diagnosed with bowel cancer when she was just 19. A week earlier, her grandmother had died of pancreatic cancer. Her mother was diagnosed with uterine cancer at the age of 39. Her family history with cancer extends back much further, with Ms O'Neill saying she tracked it back more than 200 years. 'The farthest back I have been able to go is to a relative who came to Australia on a boat as an orphan in the early 1800s,' she said. 'It covers six generations that I know of.' Lynch syndrome is a genetic condition that makes people more susceptible to a number of cancers including bowel cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, pancreatic cancer, and stomach cancer, among many others. People with the gene have an 85 per cent chance of developing cancer before the age of 70. Ms O'Neill's great-grandmother died of cancer. Just five years later, her grandmother's sister did too. She said the family was 'on notice' from that point. In the following years, four of the five remaining children, including Ms O'Neill's grandmother,  faced three of more Lynch syndrome cancers, averaging out to almost one person per decade. Family ties: Mrs O'Neil's grandmother in the arms of her great grandmother . Lynch Syndrome Australia spokeswoman Beth Fairbank said approximately 20,000 Australians have the genetic condition, but only five per cent of people were diagnosed. 'There's 95 per cent of people walking around with it and they have no idea,' Ms Fairbank said. 'A lot of families that have a history of cancer think it's just a bit of bad luck and there's nothing that can be done about it, but in some cases it isn't bad luck and there are things that can be done. 'If there is such a thing, it can be a good cancer story. There are a lot of things that you can do and it really makes people aware and alert against it. 'People who know about the condition get checked much more regularly, which greatly reduces the overall risk from cancer.' Ms O'Neill said the most important thing is for people to start asking some potentially tough questions. 'There are a lot of factors that go into it, but everyone should be asking questions and looking at their family history,' she said. 'If a lot of people in your family under 50 have or had cancer, head to your GP and ask.' Lynch syndrome not only makes someone more likely to get cancer, but it also means they will likely get the disease earlier in life. In addition to that, Ms O'Neill said she had seen each person in her family get cancer at an early age than their parent or relative of the previous generation. That trend was one of the driving factors in why her and her husband decided against having children of their own. 'There are a lot of factors that went into it - our geneticist actually said it shouldn't stop us from having kids,' she said. 'But, it was a personal decision. I had seen people in my family get cancer at younger and younger ages. 'I was diagnosed at 19. The thought of having a child who would battle with cancer while they were or a teenager or at school was too much.' March 22 is Lynch Syndrome International Awareness Day and Australians are being urged to become aware of their family's cancer history . Lynch syndrome Australia director\u00a0Eve Raets promoted the day at Rundle Mall in Adelaide over the weekend . March 22 is Lynch Syndrome International Awareness Day, and Mrs O'Neill said the day should be used to make sure people know about the condition. 'The key thing is that we really need to be raising awareness. 'There are a lot of people who don't want to know, but it has such a huge impact on families. 'Ask the questions.'",

        "document": "The pathetic excuses from friends and colleagues defending Steven Gerrard have been a joke. Unfortunately for arguably Liverpool\u2019s greatest-ever player, he proved on Sunday that Brendan Rodgers has made the correct decision to cut him loose from Anfield at the end of this season. I\u2019d be surprised if Gerrard makes the Liverpool starting line-up again, and any substitute appearances will surely only be to give the fans a wave goodbye. Why should Rodgers trust Gerrard again this season? Steven Gerrard looks dejected after seeing red just 38 seconds after coming on for Liverpool at Anfield . Gerrard stamped on Ander Herrera's right leg shortly after coming on at the start of the second half . Herrera gestures and points at Gerrard as the Liverpool midfielder reacts following the challenge . This is an experienced professional, a captain, a legend and there is nothing anyone can say that should mask the truth that he absolutely let everyone at Liverpool Football Club down. He also failed to apologise to Ander Herrera in his brief post-match interview, which showed a lack of class. Some said Gerrard was frustrated because he wasn\u2019t in the starting line-up. That might be true, but it doesn\u2019t excuse a violent stamp on an opponent\u2019s ankle. Others have said he was desperate to get involved and show his passion. After all his years in the game, with all his knowledge of this fixture, he must surely know there is only one way to show passion and commitment on such a huge occasion \u2013 and that\u2019s to make good, clean tackles, play well and get the job done. This was Liverpool\u2019s biggest game of the season, against fierce rivals, it\u2019s a game they\u2019re losing when he comes on the pitch and it\u2019s a game they need to win. Liverpool captain Gerrard looks baffled after seeing referee Martin Atkinson brandish a red card . Gerrard walks off the Anfield pitch in what was his last appearance against Man United in a Liverpool shirt . If Wayne Rooney had done it, the reaction would be far worse. There would be calls to strip him of the England captaincy. If it had been Joey Barton, the reaction would have hit fever pitch. Had it been a Chelsea player \u2013 well, the internet and the FA would have been in meltdown. There would have been talk of points deductions probably. But because it was Gerrard, the appropriate outrage has been tempered because apparently, according to the apologists, Rodgers made a mistake by failing to put him in the starting line-up. Gerrard (centre) walks past  Brendan Rodgers (left) as Emre Can (right) listens to instructions from his boss . Queens Park Rangers midfielder Joey Barton would have been ridiculed if he had made such a challenge . Last season\u2019s slip against Chelsea was accidental, the stamp on Sunday was calculated: at best it was Gerrard being a careless hot-head desperate to make a mark. At worst, it looked like a reckless player who is now past caring about the fortunes of his club. Gerrard was the main man responsible for one of Liverpool\u2019s most glorious nights back in 2005 in Istanbul. Nobody can ever take that away from him. Ten years on, there\u2019s a good chance that Gerrard\u2019s last significant act for his club could be a red card that proves to be a major factor in handing Manchester United a passage back into the Champions League \u2013 at Liverpool\u2019s expense. Gerrard\u2019s legacy is shattered. It\u2019s a sad and sorry way to go, but he only has himself to blame.

Canterbury Cathedral is the Mother Church of the worldwide Anglican Communion and seat of the Archbishop of Canterbury. The Cathedral is both a holy place and part of a World Heritage Site. Founded in 597 AD by St Augustine, it is arguably the oldest institution in the English speaking world. Over the years, the Cathedral has witnessed many historic events, perhaps most famously the murder of Archbishop St Thomas Becket in his own cathedral on 29th December 1170 by four knights acting on the order of King Henry II. The new statues of The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh were commissioned by the Friends of Canterbury Cathedral to commemorate the Diamond Jubilee of The Queen\u2019s reign and will complement statues by the Cathedral\u2019s West Door of Queen Victoria (the only other monarch to celebrate a Diamond Jubilee) and Prince Albert. The royal statues have been carved by Nina Bilbey. Since 2000, Nina has specialised in stone carving and she is presently the Senior Carving Tutor at The City and Guilds Art School London. Commissions include statues for Hampton Court Flower Show, as well as St. Pancras Station and Saint George\u2019s Chapel, Windsor.

        "document": "A 'deals on wheels' cannabis gang which used a parked Mazda near a university as its mobile drug den has been jailed. The group made \u00a3600 a day pushing the drug onto students in Cardiff after parking the black vehicle near its campus in Cathays. Four of its Kurdish members were jailed after being watched by police as they opened the car's door to one customer. Haram Kalaf (left) and Saman Ahmed (right) were among members of the gang which sold drugs from a black Mazda parked near Cardiff University . South Wales Police Officers found \u00a33,650 of cannabis and \u00a32,399 in cash inside. Haram Kalaf, 25, a failed asylum seeker and Saman Ahmed, 28, Nasir Karimi, 26, and Bakhutar Shakir, 28, were all handed sentences of between 13 and 21 months each. Cardiff Crown Court heard how the gang also used rental cars to shuttle drugs from the Mazda to customers. When police seized the vehicle they found 295 small bags of the drug hidden alongside thousands of pounds in cash stashed beneath the carpet. Nair Karimi had been living 'hand to mouth' for eight years before being jailed, the court heard . The gang was stopped when officers monitoring another of their cars watched them invite a young woman into the vehicle to buy \u00a320 of the drug. 'The car door opened as if to draw her attention, she got in and left\u00a0seconds later', prosecutor Jason Howells said. 'When she was stopped, she\u00a0said \"I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t want to get into trouble. I\u2019ve just bought some\u00a0weed for \u00a320\"'. After searching that vehicle, a Vauxhall Astra, they were taken to the Mazda where the majority of the haul was kept. Sentencing Judge Huw Rees said all of the men had come to the UK to sell drugs. 'You came here with a single purpose, to supply cannabis, making a lucrative profit. 'It was a well organised venture and the location you chose is significant - you came to an area of the city where students live, that intention is clear. 'And you used an extra vehicle with the sole purpose of storing your hoard so that if you were caught, you would only have small amounts on you.' Kalaf, a failed asylum seeker from Bristol, told police he was selling \u00a3600 of drugs every day. Ahmed, a father-of-two, was recruited as his driver while Karimi had been living 'hand to mouth' since arriving in the UK eight years earlier. Shakir, a gambling addict, had previously been arrested for drug offences. The drug dealers parked the Mazda on Rhymney Street in Cardiff and used other vehicles to shuttle drugs around the city .",

        "document": "Obese women have a 40 per cent higher risk of developing at least seven types of cancer in their lifetime . Obese women have a 40 per cent higher risk of developing at least seven types of cancer in their lifetime, according to research. These weight-related cancers include bowel, post-menopausal breast, gallbladder, womb, kidney, pancreatic and oesophageal types. Statistics released by Cancer Research UK show that obese women have around a one in four risk of developing a cancer linked to weight in their lifetime. In a group of 1,000 obese women, 274 will be diagnosed with a bodyweight-linked cancer in their lifetime, compared with 194 women diagnosed in a group of 1,000 healthy weight women. Approximately a quarter of women are classified as obese and it is estimated that 18,000 women develop cancer as a result of being overweight or obese each year. There are different ways that obesity could increase the risk of cancer. One possibility is that it is linked to the production of hormones by fat cells \u2013 especially oestrogen which is thought to fuel the disease. Around 12 per cent of postmenopausal breast cancers \u2013 a total of 5,269 women \u2013 are blamed on obesity. It is the highest number of cases linked to obesity because the cancer is so common. Last year a study found women were at double the risk of getting the disease because of their weight compared with men. Researchers said 8.2 per cent of all cancers in women in the UK were caused by being fat. The study found 4.4 per cent of all cancers in men were due to obesity. Previous estimates claimed if Britons continue to pile on the pounds, it will lead to almost 4,000 extra cancer cases a year by 2026. Dr Julie Sharp of Cancer Research UK said: 'Losing weight isn't easy, but you don't have to join a gym and run miles every day or give up your favourite food. Just making small changes that you can maintain in the long term can have a real impact. To get started, try getting off the bus a stop earlier and cutting down on fatty and sugary foods. A quarter of women are classified as obese and it is estimated that 18,000 women develop cancer as a result of being overweight or obese each year . 'Gradually build on these to achieve a healthier lifestyle that you can maintain. And find out about local services, which can provide help and support to make lifestyle changes. We know that our cancer risk depends on a combination of our genes, our environment and other aspects of our lives, many of which we can control \u2013 helping people understand how they can reduce their risk of developing cancer in the first place remains crucial in tackling the disease. 'Lifestyle changes \u2013 like not smoking, keeping a healthy weight, and cutting back on alcohol \u2013 are the big opportunities for us all to reduce our cancer risk. Making these changes is not a guarantee against cancer, but it stacks the odds in our favour.' Breast cancer patients can raise their chances of survival by exercising, a study has found. Tumours grew more slowly when mice being treated for cancer had an exercise wheel in their cage. It means that in future, breast cancer patients could be prescribed exercise as part of their treatment. As cancers grow, the blood vessels supplying them with oxygen become thin and tangled, making it harder for drugs to reach the tumour. But when US researchers from the Duke Cancer Institute in North Carolina let mice with breast cancer run on wheels, their bloody supply improved. Researcher Dr Mark Dewhirst said: 'We were truly amazed by these findings.' Macmillan Cancer Support has previously described exercise as a 'wonder drug'.",

Outburst: After a 44-day Twitter silence, Paul Gascoigne burst into a foul-mouthed rant\u00a0at friends he claim 'screwed him over' It is not clear what the ex-footballer is claiming Ms Thomas and Andy have done as most of the tweets are incoherent. The expletive-ridden rant started last night and ended this afternoon, with Gascoigne appearing to suggest he had tried to visit Ms Thomas at her work at a Post Office in Bournemouth. Last year the couple appeared to be the picture of domestic bliss, with friends saying she had helped him detox from alcohol and was willing to stand by him despite his troubles. Now friends and fans are concerned for the former England midfielder, with fears growing that Gascoigne may need help.

Gascoigne appeared to be in good health as he touched on his lengthy battle with drink, joking: 'I've been on a whiskey diet \u2013 I lost three days!' As well as making light of his dark times, the footballer also touched on the struggles of being in the spotlight. He told fellow guests Jimmy Greaves and Brand how his fundamental aim on a football pitch was to 'entertain the fans, win them over', but admitted that sometimes it all became too intense for him. He also admitted that even today 'it's sometimes hard to go to games' because he ends up 'analysing myself.' He added: 'I drive myself nuts. What would I have done there?'

The former Everton and Newcastle player last month told the High Court that phone-hacking was linked to his alcoholism. The 47-year-old former footballer gave evidence at the hearing in London to determine what compensation should be paid by Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN) in eight representative cases. In a written statement supplied to the court, Gascoigne said that his fame had brought many benefits but also caused him much heartache as he had struggled to come to terms with the end of his playing career. Constant media pressure made it very difficult for him to lead a normal life and had led to his family not being as close as they once were. He said he suffered from alcohol dependency and also had treatment for drug use and addiction to the drink Red Bull. His statement said: 'I have suffered from mental illness, including paranoia, obsessive compulsive disorder, depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation.

        "document": "A Penn State professor who was arrested on an American Airlines flight after lighting a cigarette and ranting about Obama said she was expressing an act of 'civil\u00a0disobedience'. Dr Karen Halnon, 52, became an internet sensation after she was caught on camera lighting up shortly after a flight from Nicaragua landed at Miami International Airport on Saturday. Halnon said she used the moment to protest 'U.S. military global domination,' claiming the country has 'declared war on Venezuela' and was responsible for giving her hero Hugo Chavez cancer. Dr Karen Halnon, left in her police mugshot and right in a faculty photo, said she was expressing an act of 'civil disobedience' when she was filmed smoking and ranting about the US after her plane landed in Miami . The sociology professor also said the US was after Venezuela's water and oil. 'I had to speak out now,' she told Philadelphia Magazine. 'The situation is dire and urgent.' 'Any sacrifice I make for my own self, if it saves lives \u2014 there have been far too many lives lost due to U.S. global military domination.' Halnon claims she was 'tortured' by the FBI and TSA after she was arrested in Miami for disorderly conduct. 'I was put in a room with two fans in the ceiling, it was freezing cold for hours and hours and hours,' she said. Halnon alleged she was not allowed to go to the bathroom and had to wet her pants.\u00a0She said she also defecated on the floor and was forced to pick it up while being 'laughed at'. A number of passengers around Halnon became angered after she lit up on the plane. The professor said the act was a 'symbol'. 'Every revolutionary I know smokes,' she said. 'It was identifying with the revolutionary cause. 'Beyond that, it is a symbol that the United States is a smoking gun.' Halnon also questioned how she got through security with the lighter, which she said was right on top of her book bag. Halnon is seen smoking onboard the flight, in a video uploaded to YouTube and posted on Reddit . When fellow passengers flagged down a flight attendant to complain about her unruly behavior, Halnon blamed someone else for smoking and went on a  rant, saying the US had 'declared war on Venezuela' 'The action was necessary,' she said. 'They are going to kill many more people.' During her political rant aboard the flight Halnon, who said she teaches about US imperialism in Latin America, equated the country's tough economic sanctions against Venezuela with a declaration of war. According to an eyewitness, she also allegedly said that Obama 'kills people on Tuesdays'. Halnon shouted: 'The United States has declared war on Venezuela. Venezuela has been declared a national security threat.' 'You're a national security threat,' a passenger remarked off camera. 'She's gangster' another passenger said, laughing. Flight attendants warned the woman that\u00a0the police would be waiting for her once the plane landed if she didn't calm down. But she yelled louder, ranting that Venezuela 'previously owned the oil in Venezuela.' 'My great hero Hugo Chavez nationalized the oil supply so that people would own the oil...not Exon Mobil.' After she was warned again by a flight attendant that she was going to be arrested, Halnon remarked 'I know already.' 'They already say they are arresting me so I'm going to tell you more,' she told passengers while unbuckling her seat belt and standing up. A statement from Penn State on Tuesday confirmed that Halnon is a member of staff. A flight attendant, right, warned Halnon that the police would be waiting for her once the plane landed if she didn't calm down. Halnon said she knew she was going to be arrested and wanted to speak her piece . It said: 'Penn State Abington is aware of Dr. Karen Halnon\u2019s behavior this past weekend on a flight from Nicaragua and is looking into the matter.' Halnon teaches sociology at the school's Abington campus near Philadelphia, and has the rank of associate professor. According to her faculty page, she is an expert on capitalism, Latin America and 'mad women'. Dr Halnon was award her PhD from Boston College in 1995 with a thesis about treatments for women and hysteria. She has two published books, and more than 25 journal articles to her name. The video of Halnon was captured  by a passenger who then posted the video  to\u00a0YouTube and Reddit. The redditor, with the user name 'upside down dog', alleged that he was on the same flight as Halnon when he recorded her. 'They already say they are arresting me so I'm going to tell you more,' she told passengers while unbuckling her seat belt and standing up. He  wrote: 'While the plane was waiting on the tarmac for the police to arrive, she leans over to me and asks for a cigarette. 'She pulls one out of her bag and lights up. This is the point where I pull eject and run to the back of the cabin. The police arrive after 20 minutes and escort her off the plane. 'She only had a single drink on the plane (however, others told me she was pounding them back pretty hard in the terminal and she also was on prescription painkillers)'. Halnon confirmed she only had one small bottle of wine on the plane that she said she mixed over the course of three drinks. 'I wasn't drunk,' she said. 'I don't need alcohol to protest. This is my life.'",

        "document": "The conductor of a sickening racist chant by a University of Oklahoma fraternity has been identified as a graduate of an elite Catholic school in Dallas. Parker Rice, 19, is  an OU freshman. It is believe he did not even live in the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity house, which was shut down by the university on Monday. Rice graduated last year from the prestigious Jesuit College Preparatory School of Dallas. A spokesman for the school's president, Mike Earsing, told Daily Mail Online: 'We know for sure it is one of our students and it is Parker Rice.' Daily Mail Online was the first to confirm Rice's identity. On Tuesday, university president David Boren said he has expelled two students who were identified as 'leaders' of the racist chant. A university spokesman declined to say whether Parker was one of those two students. Scroll down for video . Parker Rice, a University of Oklahoma freshman from Dallas, has been identified as the conductor leading the 'there will never be a n***** in SEA' chant on Saturday . Former classmates took to Twitter to defend Jesuit College Prep and the 'mistake' by Rice (he is pictured here with an unidentified person) Expelled: This is the letter that University of Oklahoma President David Boren sent to two students on Tuesday notifying them that they had been expelled . Former classmates at the $16,000-a-year Catholic school Rice attended also confirmed to Daily Mail Online that he is the tuxedo-clad conductor seen getting out of his seat during the nine-second clip posted online on Sunday. Rice is featured the most prominently in the video, as he pumps his fist and encourages others aboard the chartered bus to sing along with the lyrics: 'There will never be a n***** in SAE. You can hang him from a tree, but he'll never sign with me. There will never be a n***** in SAE.' The video, taken aboard a party bus Saturday night en route from the campus in Norman to the Oklahoma City Golf & Country Club, caused immediate outrage on Sunday when it was posed on social media. University officials responded by banning the fraternity from campus and demanding that members move out by midnight tonight. Rice (right) has two brothers, one older who has already graduated from Jesuit College Prep and the University of Oklahoma. His younger brother (center) is currently a student at Jesuit College Prep . Parker Rice pictured center at a recent gathering with his friends from Jesuit College Prep . Parker Rice's father Bob is a vice president at an industrial real estate firm in Dallas . Hundreds of students and faculty members marched on campus to protest the fraternity. On Tuesday morning Boran, the OU president who has given fiery rebukes of the fraternity and the racist song, announced that two members of the fraternity had been expelled. 'I have emphasized that there is zero tolerance for this kind of threatening, racist behavior at the University of Oklahoma,' he said. On Tuesday, Jesuit College Prep confirmed that Rice was the one leading the chant. School president Earsing sent a message to students, parents and alumni saying: 'In the recent video regarding OU and the SAE fraternity it appears that a graduate from Jesuit Dallas is leading the racist chant.' 'I am appalled by the actions in the video and extremely hurt by the pain this has caused our community.' He also vowed to identify all of the students who sang the chant and subject them to university punishment. On Monday he said that he was considering the use of criminal prosecution against the students involved. Rice's father Bob Rice is a vice president at real estate company Weeks Robinson Properties. He did not respond to multiple requests for comment by Daily Mail Online. Cut it off! As one frat brother gleefully sings a racist chant, another steps in and tries to cut off recording of the shameful incident . 'There will never be a n***** SAE': The vile chant was made by members of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity chapter at the University of Oklahoma. The student on the left has been identified at Parker Rice . One former high school classmate who identified Parker Rice as one of the leaders of the chant told Daily Mail Online: 'In my honest opinion, he was following his frat brothers. I don't believe he is a racist, just wanted to fit in. It's fraternity culture. You do what the elders do so you fit in. He truly is a nice guy, but I do question things now.' The student, who did not want his name used also said: 'We have a strong sense of brotherhood at Jesuit and that's why many won't say anything about Jesuit but there were other Jesuit grads on that bus chanting. 'At school he was a football player, he was the funny guy that seemed to never take anything serious. I saw him as a follower who was afraid to step out of his friend group because of fear of not being accepted. He was privileged but most of the kids at Jesuit were.' University of Oklahoma President David Boren today expelled two students identified as playing a leadership role in the singing of a racist chant in connection with an SAE fraternity event. Boren said that the students who played a leadership role had created a hostile learning environment for others. The chant was not only heard by those on a bus, but also impacted the entire university community as it was also distributed through social media. Boren said, 'I have emphasized that there is zero tolerance for this kind of threatening racist behavior at the University of Oklahoma. I hope that the entire nation will join us in having zero tolerance of such racism when it raises its ugly head in other situations across our country. I am extremely proud of the reaction and response expressed by our entire university family - students, faculty, staff, and alumni about this incident. 'They are \u201cReal Sooners\u201d who believe in mutual respect for all. I hope that students involved\u00a0in this incident will learn from this experience and realize that it is wrong to use words to hurt, threaten, and exclude other people. We will continue our investigation of all the students engaged in the singing of this chant. Once their identities have been confirmed, they will be subject to appropriate disciplinary action.' Packing up: Two SAE fraternity brothers are seen here loading furniture into a moving truck outside the closed frat house on Tuesday . University president David Boren said officials would lock up the frat house at midnight . The university is not identifying the students expelled from OU - and it warns that additional punishments are likely to follow . Out of a job: Howard Dixon, the longtime cook at SAE, will be out of a job now after the university shut down the fraternity . Rice's father Bob Rice is at senior vice president and the manager of the Texas office of Weeks Robinson, a major commercial and industrial real estate firm. According to his company biography, he has helped develop and lease 7million square feet of new industrial property. He graduated from Indiana University. Rice also has two brothers. One older brother graduated from Jesuit College Prep and University of Oklahoma. His younger brother is still at Jesuit College Prep. At least three fraternity members can be seen standing on the bus singing the racist chant. Several more can bee seen cheering and hollering. At least one female voice can also be heard in the cheering. On Monday night, it was revealed that the Delta Delta Delta sorority was on the bus with fraternity members. The OU chapter of the sorority has denied that any of its sisters are under investigation by the university - though the headquarters for the sorority said officials were cooperating with OU investigation.",

        "document": "This well-heeled hamlet north of New York City is embroiled in an increasingly nasty debate that seems oddly out of place amid the stately homes and tony boutiques: What should be done about coyotes? Self-styled coyote spotters in and around Chappaqua have counted 160 incursions into backyards and streets over the last two years and at least 10 recent attacks on pets. That's been enough to stir animal passions among residents over the question of when and if a coyote deserves to be killed. Email and social media have swirled with such teeth-baring terms as 'coyote jihad' and 'death map.' And members of a local task force that advocates trapping and killing some of the animals announced they were staying away from a recent public hearing on the issue 'in the interest of our personal safety.' Scroll down for video . Victim: Pet owner Ann Styles Brochstein holds her Havanese dog Samson near where Samson was attacked by a coyote outside her home in Chappaqua, New York . Sighting: The New Castle Coyote Management Task Force is arguing for more frequent use of 'lethal solutions' against coyotes. A Facebook page for the group posted this photo of a coyote seen November 16, 2014 . Wounded: The anti-coyote New Castle Coyote Management Task Force included this photo of dogs injured by the wild animals at the end of a presentation . 'I envisioned going down there and having blood thrown on me,' said task force member Joyce Stansell-Wong, who has since resigned. Chappaqua, about 35 miles north of the city, is better known as the home of former President Bill Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton than as a playground for coyotes. But wildlife officials say the demise of such predators as wolves and cougars over the last few decades has led to a spread of coyotes into more populated areas across the East Coast, including suburbs. Instagram and Facebook are replete with pictures of the canines scampering across sidewalks and among backyard playsets. Coyotes have even been spotted in New York City's Central Park and the Bronx. Robert Greenstein, supervisor of the Town of New Castle, which has about 18,000 residents in Chappaqua, Millwood and unincorporated areas, said that in general, the debate is between two camps: 'One group is concerned with protecting the coyotes and the other group is more concerned with protecting our pets.' The pet-protection camp, represented by the New Castle Coyote Management Task Force, argues for quicker use of 'lethal solutions.' Even though there have been no attacks on humans, they fear the skulking canines may start to attack small children. 'A menacing coyote, circling the playground, stalking children, that coyote has to go,' said task force member Ann Styles Brochstein, whose Havanese dog Samson was attacked by a coyote in their yard. Famous residents: Chappaqua, about 35 miles north of the city, is better known as the home of former President Bill Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton than as a coyote playground (file photo) 'Residents have had to alter their lifestyle significantly,' she said. 'Taking out the garbage, grilling in backyards, walking children home from bus stops and the simple act of walking dogs have all attracted coyotes. They appear on porches and decks, looking through doors at children and pets.' A separate group, represented by the New Castle Coyote Awareness and Safety Advisory Committee, is advocating more tolerance, noting that coyote attacks on humans are very unusual and that a little education \u2014 and keeping pets on leashes \u2014 can help limit close encounters. In general, they would limit killings to coyotes that attack humans or leashed pets. 'We must encourage responsible pet ownership and not penalize a coyote for taking a small dog when such an act is only doing what comes naturally,' said Victoria Alzapiedi, chairwoman of the advisory committee. In the public meeting on the issue Feb. 10, the advisory committee gave its presentation. The absent task force submitted its presentation online. Both groups did extensive research, spoke with experts and appear to agree that coexistence is inevitable. They differ, however, on the current effectiveness of 'hazing' coyotes, or trying to instill a fear of humans by making a noisy commotion when a coyote is spotted. The task force says some coyotes have gotten used to such displays and pay scant attention. New York's Department of Environmental Conservation would have to approve any shooting or trapping. Coyotes that are trapped are then euthanized rather than taken to another area. The department's guidelines offer some perspective, noting that 650 New Yorkers are hospitalized every year for dog bites and that while coyotes kill cats, 'so do foxes, dogs, bobcats, vehicles and even great horned owls.' Dan Bogan, a coyote expert who consults for the DEC, said, 'We're never going to get rid of coyotes. They're not going anywhere. People aren't going anywhere either. Coexistence is the solution.' Greenstein said town board members are studying the proposals and will hold a public work session in the next month or two to discuss them. His prediction: 'That'll be Round 2 of the fireworks.' Battle: Two groups are now fighting in Westchester County, New York, over the fate of the coyotes. The New Castle Coyote Management Task Force also posted to Facebook this photo of a November 16, 2014 sighting .",

Booked: Richards, Fofana . \u2018It\u2019s nice winning 5-0 or 3-2 but sometimes it is difficult,\u2019 Jokanovic said. \u2018If you have a champion\u2019s mentality you must suffer together and get through games like this. \u2018They caused us problems. It\u2019s positive for us because we were working all together. It wasn\u2019t a brilliant game but you\u2019ve got to be optimistic if you win these.\u2019 It\u2019s only six months since managerial turmoil looked to undermine the foundations previously laid when Billy McKinlay left after a matter of days but Watford will take some stopping from here. When all is said and done in two months\u2019 time, they will make sure not to hold any regrets. The winner came on nine minutes after Fulham goalkeeper Marcus Bettinelli, rather bizarrely, opted to travel away from his goal to retrieve a ball for Almen Abdi to whip in a wicked corner; from that Craig Cathcart\u2019s header was partially saved but Deeney was on the spot to smash in the rebound. \u2018Disappointing\u2019 was Kit Symons\u2019 summation. \u2018It\u2019s the second phase of a corner.\u2019 Jokanovic\u2019s side are top scorers in the division - netting 16 in their last five at Vicarage Road before this - but are occasionally susceptible to pace and Ross McCormack might\u2019ve drawn the visitors level soon after, only for his half-volley to be thwarted by former Tottenham stopper Heurelho Gomes. Ryan Tunnicliffe (centre) tussles with Almen Abdi for the ball during his side's defeat to Watford . Match winner Deeney fights with\u00a0Kostas Stafylidis for possession during the first half at Vicarage Road . Despite Fulham looking bright, it was the Hornets who could\u2019ve sewn the points up before half-time. Abdi is afforded the freedom to roam from his central berth and that gives Watford an added dimension. Capped by Switzerland, he buzzes in possession and isn\u2019t afraid of bypassing Deeney and Matej Vydra in pursuit of goals. Here the two strikers combined brilliantly to tee Abdi up and he thumped just wide. Make no mistake, this was not vintage Watford but you sense they don\u2019t need to be weekly, such is the quality stacked up in a well-stocked squad. Vydra crashed an effort against the bar after sparkling Adlene Guedioura footwork before Jazz Richards only saw yellow for raising his hands to the striker off the ball. Ben Watson (centre) climbs higher than Bryan Ruiz during his side's crucial victory over Fulham . Symons saw Cauley Woodrow head over from a corner and Seko Fofana\u2019s vicious strike was deflected wide. Fulham failed to build a real period of sustained pressure until introducing giant striker Matt Smith; his knockdown fell to McCormack but Gomes rushed out, spread himself and superbly blocked the Scot\u2019s certain equaliser. \u2018Matt did well when he came on,\u2019 Symons said. \u2018He\u2019s a physical presence up there and we can play a bit more direct. There was a chance at the end when Hugo Rodallega and Ross got in each other\u2019s way. We deserved a point.\u2019 Watford might usually be a pleasure to watch, but they\u2019ll be thankful for that mad Brazilian between the sticks - this ended up being as gritty as they come.",

        "document": "Nick Gordon's stepfather has revealed in a new interview that he fears for the life of Bobbi Kristina's troubled fiance. It has been reported that Gordon, 25, has threatened suicide and has been taking Xanax since Whitney Houston's daughter was found unconscious in a bathtub in late January. On Wednesday, Access Hollywood\u00a0spoke exclusively to Gordon\u2019s stepfather about his son's state of mind, asking him if he fears for Nick's life. Scroll down for video . Speaking out: Nick Gordon's father (left and right) gave an interview about the 25-year-old fiance of Bobbi Kristina Brown, who reportedly had threatened suicide . Access Hollywood will air the complete interview Thursday . 'I fear... that if something happens to Bobbi Kristina, like, if she doesn't pull it through, then I will fear for my son's life,' the stepfather stated. Access Hollywood will air the complete interview Thursday. Speaking to Dr Phil McGraw Gordon, 25, said: \u2018I lost the most legendary singer ever and I\u2019m scared to lose Krissy. I want to let all you guys know I did everything possible in the world to protect them.\u2019 Gordon\u2019s impassioned assertion was made during a dramatic intervention staged by Dr Phil last week and due to air today. Weeping and wailing and at times incoherent, Gordon had believed that he was to be interviewed by Dr Phil. Gordon had told the eminent psychologist that he wanted to tell his side of the story. He has felt \u2018vilified\u2019 and \u2018depicted as a monster\u2019 since January 31 when Bobby Kristina, 22, was found face down and unresponsive in the bath-tub at the Roswell , Georgia home he and Bobby Kristina shared. Breakdown: With his mother, Michelle, by his side Nick Gordon struggles to stay coherent . Troubling preview: A trailer for the interview of Bobbi Kristina Brown's boyfriend Nick Gordon by Dr Phil McGraw was released Sunday night. Swinging from crying  to flying into a rage, the disturbing 30 second video shows a very troubled young man in a lot of pain as he is questioned by Dr Phil . But on learning of Gordon\u2019s emotional, mental and physical state Dr Phil could not \u2018in good conscience\u2019 go on with the interview. According to Gordon\u2019s mother, Michelle, who was by her son\u2019s side during the highly emotional intervention, \u2018Nicholas is at a breaking point. He cannot bear not being without Krissy, by her side. He\u2019s dealing with it by drinking. I\u2019ve begged him to stop.\u2019 Dr Phil told Gordon, who admitted to having taken Xanax and to have drunk heavily prior to the meeting: \u2018Nick, you\u2019re out of control. You\u2019ve threatened suicide. You deserved to get some help because if you don\u2019t, you know you\u2019re going to wind up dead.\u2019 He added: \u2018You\u2019ve got to get yourself cleaned up. You got to man up and straighten up.\u2019 Yesterday DailyMail.com revealed that, barely 12 hours before the dramatic encounter with Dr Phil, Gordon was so drunk and high he was unable to walk. The disturbing scenes captured on video showed the true extent of a deterioration described by Dr Phil as \u2018exponential.\u2019 In the show, due to broadcast Wednesday, a weeping and wailing Gordon admitted that he has twice tried to kill himself and confessed: \u2018I\u2019m so sorry for everything.\u2019 Asked if he still intended to kill himself he said: \u2018If anything happens to Krissi I will.\u2019 He said: \u2018My pain is horrible. My heart hurts. I have panic attacks.\u2019 In recent weeks Gordon has twice overdosed on a mixture of Xanax, alcohol and prescription sleeping pills. Gordon had agreed to meet with Dr Phil believing that he was there to be interviewed. According to Dr Phil: 'He felt like he was being vilified and presented as some sort of monster.' Instead, on learning of Gordon's rapidly deteriorating mental, emotional and physical state, the eminent psychologist staged an intervention and he is now in rehab. Dr Phil stated: 'I don't think he has any chance of turning this round. Left to his own devices he will be dead within the week.' Gordon's mother, Michelle, was by her son's side as he alternated between compliant and aggressive \u2013 at one point threatening to attack camera men as they filmed. She described her son as 'at breaking point.' She said: 'He cannot take too much more of not being able to see Kriss. He blames himself. He's torn up and carrying guilt. 'He's dealing with it by drinking. I've begged him to stop. I've tried to help him but he can't let go of the guilt.' Leaning towards Gordon's mother, Dr Phil said: 'You and I have one mission with one possible outcome and that's for him to agree to go to rehab to deal with his depression, his guilt\u2026and to get clean and sober.' He added: 'His life absolutely hangs in the balance.' Questions still rage regarding just what happened in the early hours of January 31st that led to Bobbi Kristina, 22, ending up face down in her tub. Just two days ago Bobbi Kristina's aunt, Leolah Brown, made a series of explosive Facebook posts in which she alleged that the family had 'strong evidene of foul play' relating to Gordon's role in events. She posted: 'Nick Gordon is very disrespectful and inconsiderate! Especially to my family. Moreover, he has done things to my niece that I never thought he had in him to do!' Leolah made her claims in response to being invited onto Dr Phil's show. Tough to watch: The young man sobs and shakes at times through the trailer . In her message she wrote: 'With all due respect, Nick Gordon is under investigation for the attempted murder of my niece\u2026.We have strong evidence of foul play.' Marks were found on her face and arms, marks that Gordon has explained as the result of CPR which he administered to her for 15 minutes before emergency services arrived. And speaking to Dr Phil, Gordon insisted: 'I did everything possible in the world to protect them [Whitney and Bobbi Kristina].' Railing against the decision by Bobbi's father, Bobby Brown, to ban him from his fianc\u00e9e's bedside at Atlanta's Emory Hospital, Gordon said: 'My name will be the first she calls.' According to his mother, Michelle, Gordon cannot forgive himself for his 'failure' to revive Bobbi Kristina. His guilt is compounded by the eerily similar situation in which he found himself almost exactly three years earlier. 'I hate Bobby Brown!'\u00a0His tears quickly turn to anger when he brings up his girlfriend's father Bobby Brown, who has blocked him from seeing the 22-year-old in the hospital . 'Are you drinking?' The emotional man's anger only increases as Dr. Phil asks about Nick's sobriety . Refuses to go: The 25-year-old aspiring rapper storms out when told he needs help . Resigned: Ultimately, Gordon concedes that he needs help and leaves for a rehab facility . Then, on 11 February 2012, it was Gordon who tried to resuscitate Whitney when she was found unresponsive in her bath-tub just hours before she was due to attend a Grammy awards party. Speaking to Dr Phil, Michelle said: 'Nicholas just continually expresses how much he has failed Whitney. 'He administered CPR [to Whitney] and he called me when he was standing over her body. He couldn't understand why he couldn't revive her. He said, \"Mommy why? I couldn't get the air into her lungs.\" Gordon has now entered a rehab facility in Atlanta. Meanwhile his fianc\u00e9e continues to fight for her life in a medically-induced coma. It is now six weeks since Bobbi Kristina \u2013 Krissi as she was known to friends - was found face down and unresponsive in the bath-tub of the home she shared with Gordon in Roswell, Georgia. Unlike Whitney's death that was ruled accidental, police are treating Bobbi Kristina's near drowning and injuries allegedly sustained by the 22-year-old as a criminal investigation. While Bobbi Kristina fights for her life a troubling picture of her relationship with Nick, of drug use and domestic turbulence in the weeks leading up to the incident, has emerged. In an interview with The Sun \u00a0a friend of the couple, Steven Stepho, claimed they were using various drugs daily including heroin, Xanax, pot and heroin substitute Roxicodone. Sounding eerily similar to Bobbi's mother and father's drug-dependent relationship, the friend said the pair used whatever they could get their hands on. 'Bobbi and Nick would spend a lot on drugs every day, it just depended on how much money they had. It wasn't unusual for them to spend $1,000 a day on drugs. 'There were times when it got really bad - they would be completely passed out for hours, just lying there on the bed. There were times when she would be so knocked out she would burn herself with a cigarette and not even notice. She was always covered in cigarette burns.' Their relationship was also very volatile. 'When Whitney died Nick was left with nothing, so he knew he had to control Krissi to get access to the money. She'd do whatever he told her. 'He was very manipulative and would even use the drugs to control her. They would argue a lot and there were times when he would be violent with her and push her around.' According to Stepho: 'But Krissi really loved him because he was there to fill the gap left by her mother. She was not close to her father and did not have anyone else close to her. Nick knew this and took advantage of it.' Troubled relationship: A friend of the couple, Steven Stepho, claimed the pair were using various drugs daily including heroin, Xanax, pot and heroin substitute Roxicodone .",

        "document": "(CNN)CNN has learned that the manufacturer of the endoscope involved in two superbug deaths at UCLA never obtained permission to sell the device, according to an official at the Food and Drug Administration. Olympus started selling its TJF-Q180V duodenoscope in 2010, but the FDA didn't notice until late 2013 or early 2014 that the company had never asked for clearance to put it on the market, according to Karen Riley, deputy director of strategy for the FDA's Office of External Affairs. \"Why didn't we notice it? I don't know,\" Riley said. \"Can you imagine a prescription drug getting out on the market that didn't go through the approval process?\" asked Dr. Steven Nissen, the chief of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic, who's testified to Congress about device safety problems. \"Devices need to be regulated more vigorously. This is really disturbing.\" In a statement, Olympus said it didn't think needed the FDA's permission to sell the device, but now at the request of the agency, it has applied for that permission. That application is still pending. Seven hospital patients at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center were infected with the deadly superbug CRE -- also known as carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae -- from October to January, according to hospital officials. Two of those patients died. The patients caught CRE after routine endoscopic treatments. Hospital officials believe two medical scopes that still carried the deadly bacteria even after disinfection guidelines were followed were the cause of the superbug outbreak. The medical center has contacted 179 others who had endoscopic procedures between October and January and is offering them home tests to screen for the bacteria. Four other patients at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles have also been infected with  the superbug linked to a contaminated  duodenoscope, according to a statement released by the hospital. The medical scope was used in all four patients, between August and January 2015. Sixty-four other patients who had a duodenoscope procedure with that particular scope are being informed by mail, \"out of an abundance of caution.\" According to FDA rules, a manufacturer must seek clearance for a new model if it includes changes that \"could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device.\" The TJF-Q180V duodenoscope, used to check out ducts in the gastrointestinal system, includes a modification to the exact part of the device that's been implicated in the superbug outbreaks. With this new model, Olympus sealed up that part of the device, known as the elevator channel, hoping to make it more impervious to infection. \"The company clearly made these modifications to make the device safer, but it seems to be that it wasn't safer,\" Riley said. Last year, at the FDA's request, Olympus applied for permission to sell the scope. That application is still pending. Riley emphasized that duodenoscope procedures can be lifesaving, so the agency doesn't want to take them off the market. \"More than 500,000 of these procedures are done every year in the U.S., and the risk of bacterial transmission is actually really very, very low,\" she said. \"We believe the benefits outweigh the risks.\" In its statement, Olympus wrote: \"The emergence of drug-resistant microorganisms is a challenge to the entire health care community.  Olympus is working with relevant medical societies and our customers in research of this emerging issue and the development of additional safeguards to prevent infection associated with [duodenoscope procedures].\" Riley noted that the other two duodenoscope manufacturers, Pentax and Fujifilm, did apply for and were granted clearance to market models similar to Olympus' TJF-Q180V. Now the FDA is asking all three companies to submit evidence that the scopes can be thoroughly cleaned -- and so far it's not going well. Riley said twice the companies have submitted data that failed to show that cleaning could get rid of 99.9999% of all microbes on the scope -- the FDA's standard for disinfection. \"We're still working with them to get good data,\" she said. Riley said she doesn't know if the FDA will penalize Olympus for selling the device without permission. Diana Zuckerman, a device safety expert, said they should. \"It's like with kids. How do you teach your children to behave if there are no consequences when they misbehave?\" she said.",

Schalke produced one of the best performances of the season to claim a 4-3 victory at the Bernabeu but were eliminated 5-4 on aggregate after losing last month's last 16 first leg in Gelsenkirchen 2-0. 'On the one hand we are of course very happy that we managed to win but at the same time it's a bit hard to take in that we scored four goals in Madrid and didn't get through,' Italian Di Matteo told a news conference. Roberto Di Matteo issues instructions to his players from the touchline during the 4-3 win against Real Madrid . Former Chelsea boss Di Matteo admitted Schalke's Champions League exit was hard to take after netting four . Klaas-Jan Huntelaar scored twice against his former club as Schalke were eliminated . Netherlands striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, a former Real player, struck twice for the Bundesliga side, including an 84th-minute stunner that put them within a goal of pulling off a remarkable comeback. It was Real's first Champions League defeat at home in 22 games since Barcelona beat them 2-0 in April 2011 and was only the second time they had conceded four goals in a European game at the Bernabeu. However, a Cristiano Ronaldo double and a Karim Benzema strike were enough to secure a place for Real in the draw for the last eight on March 20. The Dutch striker's brace was not enough to see the Bundeliga outfit though after a 2-0 defeat in the first leg . 'I was hoping we could go into the break 2-1 up but we unfortunately didn't manage it. That would of course have made the game more interesting for us,' added Di Matteo. 'Perhaps we just didn't have that little bit of luck tonight that you need to get through such ties.' Schalke return to action in the Bundesliga with a game at Hertha Berlin on Saturday. They are fifth with 10 games left, three points behind third-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach, and have a good chance of winning a berth in Europe's elite club competition again for next season. Cristiano Ronaldo scored twice for Real Madrid as they made it through to the Champions League last eight . The Portugal forward heads the ball past Schalke goalkeeper Timon Wellenreuther at the Bernabeu . Di Matteo said the quality of Real's forwards had been the difference between the two sides, who met at the same stage last term when Real won 9-2 on aggregate on their way to a record-extending 10th European crown. 'We didn't allow Real Madrid to get into a rhythm but they have such quality in the team and they showed that both in the first leg and tonight,' Di Matteo said. 'They had relatively few chances and scored three goals and that makes a difference. Like our Real Madrid Facebook page.",

Insulted: Barbara says she hasn't shot at the company for several months and that their using her image is a 'slap in the face' One of those models named Barbara who goes by the Twitter handle @boredbarbara responded to the company's decision to post an image of her on Facebook in order to promote diversity. 'Have not shot for AA in months bc the money isnt anywhere near right and now an even bigger slap in the face loo,' she tweeted on Tuesday after the company posted her photo. She responded to the company calling their old models 'Instagram hoes,' by Tweeting, 'just bc some girls took their brand into their own hands and garnered attention for it doesn't mean they're less credible than others.' Barbara isn't the only model hitting back at the company over their decision to veer away from their old image. Another 'curvy' American Apparel model named Megan Fay who goes by @meganfayy on Twitter wrote a message about the importance of self-love on Tuesday. The email: This leaked company email said the company was going through a rebranding and would be hiring only 'real models' and not 'Intsagram hoes' or THOTS' Model of Instagram: Barbara posts photos of herself on Instagram in an attempt to take her brand into 'her own hands' and criticized the company for calling models 'Instgram hoes' Showing support: Barbara said that models who use Instagram to promote themselves are just as credible as other models . 'My goal with modeling has always been/will be to promote positive body image & inspire people to love themselves. Nothing can change that,' Fay wrote. 'Love yourself. Love your body. You are beautiful the way you are. Anyone who tells you otherwise is not worth your time,' she also said. American Apparel model Valerie Chris also piped up and tweeted about the company's choice of words \u00a0to describe their former models.

So good luck with that rebranding if that's the attitude moving forward,' the model tweeted under her account @valeriechris_ on Tuesday. 'Cuz these girls are far above and beyond the level of calling other women hoes or degrading their work,' she added in another tweet. The company has desperately been trying to rebrand their image after the former CEO Dov Charney was fired following the company's willful misconduct claims that he 'acted inappropriately' and 'sexually harassed employees.' Charney was the mastermind behind the famed ads that were sometimes criticized for being too racy or 'pornographic.' Far from deserving: Model Valerie Chris tweeted about her disgust after the leaked company email surfaced . Good luck: Valerie Chris wished the company good luck with rebranding their image after the email calling their models 'Instagram hoes' surfaced . Degrading: Valerie Chris called the the company email 'degrading' in the way it criticized models' work . American Apparel would sometimes even employ porn actors as models. This month the company began airbrushing off models' nipples on their website in an attempt to make the advertisements less sexual in nature. Notorious model Jessie Andrews who has worked as a pornographic actor, a club DJ, and jewelry designer posed for the brand in the past and this week shared her opinion about the company's attempt to change their look. 'I'm really disappointed in the new AA CEO. Go create your own brand from scratch. Don't try to change a brand that stands for so much...' she tweeted on Tuesday under her account @jessieslife.

Rebranding: Jessie Andrews also criticized the company for blurring out nipples and public hair on their website in attempt to make their adverts less racy and 'pornographic' Photoshop: Jessie Andrews dug on the company's rebranding and their attempt to photoshop out nipples and hire more conventional models . 'Why blur nipples & pubic hair out when you're selling see-through lingerie?! You are not selling it to 12 yr olds! This is what made AA, AA,' she wrote on Tuesday. 'AA models work so hard to promote positive body images. You were given a body. Love it. Be proud. Don't fall into a mold,' she also tweeted on Tuesday. Casting director Phira Luon who wrote the email on March 18 that was later obtained by The New York Post issued a formal apology and said the email, 'was just an inappropriate off colour joke that was not intended to defame the clients name or philosophy/views in anyway,\u2019 reported\u00a0News.au.com. Nip no nip: The model on the left in see through white lingerie once had her nipples and pubic hair in full display more like the model in the back lingerie on the right . '[The] company is going through a rebranding image, so we will be shooting models moving forward.\u00a0Real models. Not Instagram hoes or THOTs,' read the email in its entirety. News.au.com also reported that American Apparel\u2019s new senior vice president of marketing, Cynthia Erland, allegedly told employees that they would not hire models who were 'too short and round.' 'It\u2019s become a running joke around the office \u2014 like, \"I can\u2019t do this, I\u2019m too short and round,' \u00a0said one employee who alleges they heard heard the remark. 'I\u2019ve never felt marginalised or unattractive working for this company until his past week or so,' that employee added. Erland responded to News.com.au in a statement that said, 'This is completely false. American Apparel embraces body types of all shapes, ethnicities and sizes, and our model casting has and will continue to reflect this.'

        "document": "(CNN)For the second time, a Georgia woman's execution has been postponed -- this time because of concerns about the drugs to be used. Kelly Renee Gissendaner was scheduled to die at 7 p.m. ET Monday. \"Prior to the execution, the drugs were sent to an independent lab for testing of potency. The drugs fell within the acceptable testing limits,\" the Georgia Department of Corrections said in a statement. \"Within the hours leading up to the scheduled execution, the Execution Team performed the necessary checks. At that time, the drugs appeared cloudy. The Department of Corrections immediately consulted with a pharmacist, and in an abundance of caution, Inmate Gissendaner's execution has been postponed.\" The 47-year-old was originally scheduled to die on Wednesday, but that execution was called off because of winter weather. A petition saying the mother of three has turned her life around, even earning a theology degree while in prison, had garnered about 80,000 signatures as of Tuesday morning. Organizers plan to deliver it to Gov. Nathan Deal, though in Georgia, the governor has no authority to grant clemency. Gissendaner has become a \"powerful voice for good,\" the petition says of the woman convicted of orchestrating her husband's death in 1997. \"While incarcerated, she has been a pastoral presence to many, teaching, preaching and living a life of purpose,\" the petition states. \"Kelly is a living testament to the possibility of change and the power of hope. She is an extraordinary example of the rehabilitation that the corrections system aims to produce.\" On Sunday night, about 200 people attended a vigil at Emory University's Cannon Chapel, where they sang her praises. \"Killing her is not going to bring anything back. It's not going to undo what's been done,\" priest Kelly Zappa told CNN affiliate WSB. The pleas did not sway Georgia's high court or its board of pardons. In a 5-2 decision Monday afternoon, the state Supreme Court denied her request for a stay, and it also dismissed a constitutional challenge claiming that her sentence was disproportionate. And the State Board of Pardons and Paroles said Monday evening that its decision last week to deny clemency in the case stands. Not since Lena Baker, an African-American convicted of murder and pardoned decades later, has Georgia executed a woman. The state was scheduled to snap that 70-year streak last week before Gissendaner's execution was first postponed. Just hours before she was scheduled to die by injection at the Georgia Diagnostic and Classification State Prison in Jackson last Wednesday, the Georgia Department of Corrections announced it had postponed the execution until Monday at 7 p.m. \"due to weather and associated scheduling issues,\" department spokeswoman Gwendolyn Hogan said. Gissendaner was convicted in a February 1997 murder plot that targeted her husband in suburban Atlanta. She was romantically involved with Gregory Owen and conspired with the 43-year-old to have her husband, Douglas Gissendaner, killed, according to court testimony. Owen wanted Kelly Gissendaner to file for a divorce, but she was concerned that her husband would \"not leave her alone if she simply divorced him,\" court documents said. The Gissendaners had already divorced once, in 1993, and they remarried in 1995. Details of the crime, as laid out at trial and provided by Georgia Attorney General Sam Olens, are as follows: . Kelly Gissendaner and Owen planned the murder for months. On February 7, 1997, she dropped Owen off at her home, gave him a nightstick and hunting knife, and went out dancing with girlfriends. Douglas Gissendaner also spent the evening away from home, going to a church friend's house to work on cars. Owen lay in wait until he returned. When Douglas Gissendaner came home around 11:30 p.m., Owen forced him by knifepoint into a car and drove him to a remote area of Gwinnett County. There, Owen ordered his victim into the woods, took his watch and wallet to make it look like a robbery, hit him in the head with the nightstick and stabbed Douglas Gissendaner in the neck eight to 10 times. Kelly Gissendaner arrived just as the murder took place, but she did not immediately get out of her car. She later checked to make sure her husband was dead, then Owen followed her in Douglas Gissendaner's car to retrieve a can of kerosene that Kelly Gissendaner had left for him. Owen set her husband's car on fire in an effort to hide evidence and left the scene with Kelly Gissendaner. Police discovered the burned-out automobile the morning after the murder but did not find the body. Authorities kicked off a search. Kelly Gissendaner, meanwhile, went on local television appealing to the public for information on her husband's whereabouts. Her and Owen's story started to unravel after a series of police interviews. On February 20, Douglas Gissendaner's face-down body was found about a mile from his car. An autopsy determined the cause of death to be knife wounds to the neck, but the medical examiner couldn't tell which strike killed Douglas Gissendaner because animals had devoured the skin and soft tissue on the right side of his neck. On February 24, Owen confessed to the killing and implicated Kelly Gissendaner, who was arrested the next day and charged. While in jail awaiting trial, Kelly Gissendaner grew angry when she heard that Owen was to receive a 25-year sentence for his role in the murder. (Owen is serving life in prison at a facility in Davisboro, according to Georgia Department of Corrections records.) She began writing letters to hire a third person who would falsely confess to taking her to the crime scene at gunpoint. She asked her cellmate, Laura McDuffie, to find someone willing to do the job for $10,000, and McDuffie turned Kelly Gissendaner's letters over to authorities via her attorney. Kelly Gissendaner has exhausted all state and federal appeals, the attorney general said in a statement last week. In the clemency application, Gissendaner's lawyers argued she was equally or less culpable than Owen, who actually did the killing. Both defendants were offered identical plea bargains before trial: life in prison with an agreement to not seek parole for 25 years. Owen accepted the plea bargain and testified against his former girlfriend. Gissendaner was willing to plead guilty, her current lawyers said, but consulted with her trial lawyer and asked prosecutors to remove the stipulation about waiting 25 years to apply for parole. According to her clemency appeal, her lead trial attorney, Edwin Wilson, said he thought the jury would not sentence her to death \"because she was a woman and because she did not actually kill Doug. ... I should have pushed her to take the plea but did not because I thought we would get straight up life if she was convicted.\" Her appeal lawyers also argued that Gissendaner had expressed deep remorse for her actions, become a model inmate and grown spiritually. They said her death would cause further hardship for her children. For her last meal, she requested an extravagant one: two Burger King Whoppers with cheese (with everything), two large orders of fries, popcorn, cornbread, a side of buttermilk and a salad with tomatoes, bell peppers, onions, carrots, cheese, boiled eggs and Newman's Own buttermilk dressing, the Corrections Department said. She also requested a glass of lemonade and cherry-vanilla ice cream for dessert. According to the Death Penalty Information Center: . \u2022 Between 1973 and 2012 -- the most recent data available -- 178 death sentences were imposed upon female offenders. These sentences constitute about 2% of all death sentences. \u2022 Five states -- North Carolina, Florida, California, Ohio and Texas -- account for over half of all such sentences. \u2022 As of December 31, 2012, there were 61 women on death row. \u2022 Women on death row range in age from 28 to 79. They have been on death row from a few months to over 26 years. Currently the only woman on Georgia's death row, Gissendaner would be the second woman in the state's history to be executed. The first was Baker, an African-American maid who was sentenced to death by an all-white, all-male jury in 1944. She claimed self-defense for killing a man who held her against her will, threatened her life and appeared poised to hit her with a metal bar before she fired a fatal shot. Sixty years after her execution, Georgia's parole board posthumously pardoned her after finding that \"it was a grievous error to deny (her) clemency.\" Such pardons are rare, but so are executions of women. According to the Death Penalty Information Center, only 15 women have been executed in the United States since 1977. CNN's Holly Yan, Tina Burnside, Greg Botelho, Tristan Smith and John Murgatroyd contributed to this report.",

        "document": "(CNN)It's a striking image: a new baby cradled in the American flag, held by a Navy sailor whose face we can't see. But is it a patriotic photograph or desecration of the American flag? Navy veteran Vanessa Hicks, a Virginia Beach photographer whose website is filled with sweet images of babies and their parents, shot the picture of the sailor and his baby and posted it to her Facebook page. \"I do believe that this picture right here shows what it means to be an American,\" Hicks told CNN affiliate WTKR.\"That flag, the uniform, that baby -- exactly what every service member is out there fighting.\" Not everyone agreed with Hicks, herself a Navy wife whose husband is deployed. A Facebook page titled \"You call yourself a photographer?\" posted her photo and said that the use of the flag as a prop was a desecration -- and a bad picture. The U.S. Flag Code does state that the flag should never be used as \"wearing apparel, bedding, or drapery.  It should never be festooned, drawn back, nor up, in folds, but always allowed to fall free,\" according to a Congressional Research Service report (PDF). Nor should it be \"used as a receptacle for receiving, holding, carrying, or delivering anything.\" The threatening private messages, which she has reported to Facebook, saddened her. But she decided to keep posting the picture and to take pictures of other members of the military who request the same picture with their babies and the flag. Most people posting to the critical Facebook page disagree with the criticism of the picture. Wrote one poster, \"I am a veteran and find this picture beautiful. Clearly the military member loves his country and baby.\" \"The photo is making a point,\" another photo fan posted. \"The flag represents our republic, the republic is supporting our future. There is nothing disrespectful about this use of our flag. It is beautiful.\"",

Hart denied Messi from the penalty spot in the first-leg to give the Citizens a slim chance of progression in the second-leg, but it just wasn\u2019t to be as Ivan Rakitic\u2019s goal secured Barcelona\u2019s spot in the last eight.

        "document": "Secretary of State John Kerry spent five minutes of a Senate hearing excoriating a group of 47 Republicans who sent a highly unusual letter to the government of Iran warning that Congress could modify the terms of any nuclear deal it negotiates with the White House. 'This letter raises questions of judgment and policy,' he insisted, before Tennessee Republican Sen. Bob Corker cut him off and scolded him for delivering 'a well-written speech.' 'It's not a speech! This is not a speech!' Kerry erupted. 'This is a statement about the impact of this irresponsible letter. The letter does not have legal authority, and I think you have to ask what people are trying to accomplish.' Kerry later staked out a position that lawmakers have no standing to change any nuclear agreement between the U.S. and Iran because it won't be 'legally binding' in the first place. Scroll down for video . Secretary of State John Kerry testified on Capitol Hill in Washington on Wednesday, saying Congress won't have a role in determining the terms of a nuclear deal with Iran because the agreement isn't 'legally binding' A Code Pink protester holding a sign saying 'There is no military solution' in the Middle East was removed from Wednesday's hearing after heckling Kerry . IT'S A NICE SPEECH: Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker scolded Kerry for lecturing his former Senate colleagues about the role of Congress in ratifying deals with other countries . 'We've been clear from the beginning: We're not negotiating a, quote, \"legally binding\" plan,' Kerry told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 'We're negotiating a plan that will have in it the capacity for enforcement. We don't even have diplomatic relations with Iran right now.' He blamed Arkansas Republican Sen. Tom Cotton and 46 other GOP senators for signing a letter on Monday that 'ignores more than two centuries of precedent in the conduct of American foreign policy.' Kerry, America's top diplomat and the Obama administration's senior Tehran negotiator, said he reacted with 'utter disbelief' to the letter, which also warned Iran's leaders that an accord with President Barack Obama's team could expire the day he leaves office. The letter itself is an unprecedented intervention by Congress into negotiations with a foreign power, Kerry suggested. 'During my 29 years in the Senate I never heard of, or even heard of it being proposed, anything comparable to this,' he said. 'This letter ignores more than two centuries of precedent in the conduct of American foreign policy.' 'When it says that Congress could actually modify the terms of an agreement at any time is flat wrong,' said Kerry, who once chaired the committ he addressed on Wednedsay. 'You don't have the right to modify an agreement reached executive to executive between leaders of a country.' Cotton, a freshman senator, does not sit on the Foreign Relations panel. The administration has been forced into a no-win situation in the Middle East, with the so-called 'Islamic State' gaining territory in Iraq while the Iranians help push them back. 'They want us to destroy ISIS. They want to destroy ISIS,' Kerry said during an exchange with Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio. 'ISIS is a threat to them,' he said of Iran. 'It is a threat to the region. I think you are misreading it if you think there is not a mutual interest.' Kerry claimed the U.S.\u00a0has 'the capacity' to 'knock out ISIL' on its own, but 'we're not going to get suckered into that.' 'The enduring transformation that has to take place here is not going to take place if the United States just comes in and were to knock out ISIL and that\u2019s it \u2013 go away,' he said, adding that it's 'not gonna happen.' But Cotton's letter, also signed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and several Republican presidential hopefuls, was Exhibit A on Wednesday. Formal treaties require ratification by two-thirds of the Senate, but 'the vast majority of international arrangements and agreements do not,' Kerry said. 'And around the world today we have all kinds of executive agreements that we deal with,' including 'any number of noncontroversial, broadly supported foreign policy goals.' START OF IT ALL: Arkansas freshman Senator Tom Cotton wrote a letter to Iran's leaders and persuaded 46 other Republicans in the Senate to sign it with him . The Obama administration and Senate Democrats have harshly condemned Cotton's letter, which was presented to leaders of the Islamic republic as a primer on the U.S. Constitution. It warned that 'the next president could revoke such an executive agreement with the stroke of a pen and future Congresses could modify the terms of the agreement at any time.' As Kerry's turn on the hot seat began, protesters from the liberal anti-war group Code Pink interrupted \u2013 as they have done in other recent hearings. Like Arizona Sen. John McCain, who last month called them 'low-life scum' as they were led out of a hearing room, Kerry fired back at a woman who shouted repeatedly that 'the United States is killing innocent civilians with drones!' 'Killing more innocent people?' he asked aloud. 'I wonder how our journalists, who were beheaded, and a pilot who was fighting for freedom \u2013 burned alive \u2013 what they would have to say to their efforts to protect innocent people.' ENEMY OF MY ENEMY: Florida Sen. Marco Rubio heard Kerry say that Iran is helpful in fighting the ISIS terror army . The secretary of state will meet Iran's foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, next week in Switzerland for another round of talks. He said Cotton's letter 'erroneously asserts that this is a legally binding plan. It's not, that's number one.' 'Number two, it's incorrect when it says that Congress could actually modify the terms of an agreement at any time. That's flat wrong,' he continued. 'They don't have the right to modify an agreement reached executive to executive between leaders.' Neither the U.S. nor Iran has emphasized the need for a legally binding deal because each has stronger forms of leverage. If Iran cheats, the Obama administration has spoken of re-imposing suspended sanctions. The U.S. has also held out the prospect of military action if Iran makes progress toward a nuclear weapon. Similarly, if the U.S. doesn't live up to its side of the bargain, the Iranians can ramp up enrichment levels of uranium, taking them closer to nuclear weapons capacity. Congress, too, wields a threat: new forms of economic punishment of Iran that would be forbidden in the agreement. But such a move would almost surely require overriding a presidential veto and could pin any diplomatic collapse on the United States. Negotiators from the U.S., Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia hope to seal a framework with Iran by month's end and a comprehensive agreement by July. Kerry scoffed at the notion that Obama's successor would discard a deal reached between so many powerful governments and adhered to by Iran. 'I'd like to see the next president, if all of those countries have said this is good and it's working, turn around and just nullify it on behalf of the United States,' he said. 'That's not going to happen.' READY TO MAKE HISTORY: Kerry shook hands with new Defense Secretary Ash Carter (left) as protesters anticipated the start of Wednesday's hearing . Questions about the process involved in any agreement with Shiite-majority Iran are sensitive for a variety of reasons. Israel, Sunni Arab countries and many U.S. lawmakers are concerned that international negotiators could be placing too much trust in Iran. The prospects of a 'nonbinding' pact will hardly alleviate their concerns, even if none of them have professed faith in Iran abiding by the terms of an agreement that would ease sanctions in exchange for at least a decade of strict limits on the Iranian nuclear program. Iran says its program is solely for peaceful energy and medical research purposes. On Tuesday, Jen Psaki, Kerry's spokeswoman, raised the possibility of the deal assuming legal character through the U.N. Security Council. Psaki didn't speak definitively on the matter but cited the example of a 2013 strategy agreed to between the U.S. and Russia on Syria relinquishing its chemical weapons stockpile. That plan was then endorsed by the United Nations' top body. 'This framework was not legally binding and was not subject to congressional approval,' Psaki told reporters during a daily press briefing. 'It outlined steps for eliminating Syria's chemical weapons and helped lay the groundwork for successful multilateral efforts to move forward.' In that case, she added, the U.S.-Russian agreement 'went to the U.N. to the Security Council vote.' Zarif is the only one who has gone on record saying such a model would be followed with a nuclear deal. U.S. negotiators have been more circumspect. Making such a declaration would amount to telling Congress that it won't have a say on the accord, because it is not a treaty, but that the United Nations will.",

A man has been arrested on arson charges after firefighters raced to his burning Colorado home and found 'my wife is a cheater' scrawled on the outside of the house. William Lindauer, 31, was taken into custody hours after the early-morning blaze on Nelson Street, Arvada on Tuesday, police said. He made his first court appearance in Jefferson County court on Wednesday morning. Jail records show he is being held on investigation of first-degree arson, reckless endangerment, prohibited use of weapons, cruelty to animals and criminal mischief, ABC7 reported. His wife filed for divorce in October 2013 and it was completed on February 18, 2014, the channel reported. Property records list him at the address with Brianne Lindauer, 29. Neighbors said that three young children lived at the home but that they had not seen the woman or her children in weeks, ABC7 reported. The Arvada Fire Protection District said everyone in the home had been accounted for and there were no reports of injuries. After multiple calls from neighbors, the district responded to the home early on Tuesday and found it engulfed in flames. Blaze: Firefighters in Arvada, Colorado found the words 'My wife is a cheater' scrawled on a side of the home . Blaze: Firefighters were able to put out the flames but the home is significantly damaged by the fire . 'Upon their arrival, they were faced with a lot of fire that was coming from the front of the house as well as the back of the house,' spokesperson Deputy Fire Marshall Deanna Harrington told the Denver Post. Crews were initially unable to enter the home because the floor has been weakened by the 'very significant' damage, she said. They also found a\u00a0name had been painted on the side of the house but it is not clear if he is connected to the fire. After the flames were brought under control, officials covered up the scrawled words with blue tarps. Destroyed: Later on Tuesday morning, firefighters covered the graffiti outside the house with blue tarps . Debris was also found in the street, including patio furniture, fire officials said. Police said that investigations showed the fire had been intentionally set. The Arvada Fire Protection District and Arvada Police Department are conducting a joint investigation into the blaze. Neighbors expressed their shock over the incident. 'It's a younger family,' Fred Holman told KDVR. 'They've lived here about five years, maybe a little longer. They're very nice people, very good neighbors. I would never think anything like this would happen.'",

        "document": "It says something for the way things have changed in English football that Arsene Wenger admitted only last week that Arsenal have no chance of winning the Barclays Premier League. The same, of course, could be said of Manchester United. It is, we should remind ourselves, only the start of March. Given United\u2019s enduring financial capacity, it should not be too long before the most successful club of the Premier League era are competing with Manchester City and Chelsea at the top of the table once more. (Left to right) Marcos Rojo, Phil Jones, Jonny Evans and Michael Carrick warm-up during training on Sunday .

Manchester United duo Antonio Valencia and Daley Blind are both expected to start against Arsenal . United duo Jones (left) and Falcao (right) will be hoping to start against Arsene Wenger's side . As for Arsenal, it is more difficult to say. Arsene Wenger\u2019s team have been a peripheral concern for quite a while now. Whatever the case, on Monday night at Old Trafford, these great modern rivals come together with something more at stake than a place in the last four of the FA Cup. With United not involved in Europe this season and Arsenal staring at likely Champions League expulsion in Monaco next week \u2014 they trail 3-1 after the last-16 home leg \u2014 victory tonight would at least keep one of them relevant from a domestic point of view. No wonder United staff have been encouraging supporters to bring flags and banners to Old Trafford in a bid to bolster tonight\u2019s atmosphere. This may not be a cup final but it may feel a little bit like one. \u2018United and Arsenal are placed third and fourth in the Premier League so it\u2019s almost like a final, I think,\u2019 said United manager Louis van Gaal. \u2018It is a big event with two good teams. I hope we can give a fantastic match for the fans. United boss Louis van Gaal is targeting his first piece of silverware since arriving at Old Trafford last summer . Wayne Rooney during United's training session at Carrington on Sunday ahead of the game . \u2018I think if we beat them it is a big blow for them but if they beat us it is a big blow for us. It is a very important game, not only for the FA Cup but also for the rest of the season.\u2019 United have not won the FA Cup for 11 years. Arsenal are the holders after last season\u2019s victory over Hull but, prior to that, their previous success in the competition had come back in 2005. This says much for the manner in which both clubs\u2019 focus has been elsewhere for so long. Arsenal and United have always valued the FA Cup but, during the years they disputed the league title and had grand aspirations in Europe, it was occasionally allowed to slide down the priority list. That is no longer the case. Van Gaal in particular has been respectful towards the game\u2019s most famous cup competition ever since he arrived in Manchester last summer and has made no attempt to hide what it would mean to him \u2014 and his club \u2014 if United could win it. The first trophy Van Gaal ever won as a coach was Holland\u2019s KNVB Cup with Ajax in 1993. He still considers his first Dutch championship, which arrived a year later, as the most important trophy of his coaching career. But he admitted he understood Jose Mourinho\u2019s view that his most crucial success in England was his first \u2014 the 2005 League Cup triumph. Francis Coquelin evads the challenge for Aaron Ramsey during Arsenal's Sunday training session at Colney . Arsenal forward Danny Welbeck gets through some speed work at his side's St Albans base . Ramsey strides forward during the Gunners' last field session before facing United on Monday night . The Gunners squad are put through their paces as they look to reach Wembley for the third time in two years . Laurent Koscielny puts in the effort with a sprint as Wengers' team got ready for the vital game at Old Trafford . \u2018You can say you play for your profession but that is not enough,\u2019 said Van Gaal. \u2018You want to win something. That is why you play and coach. The players want to win something and also the manager and also the fans. \u2018When you win a title like the FA Cup, which in England is very important, and when you fight for something and you get it, you are pleased and that is why Jose Mourinho is saying what he says about his first one. \u2018When you compare coaches with one another then titles are very important. And when a player wins something, they then have the experience of winning a final so there are a lot of positive things.\u2019 Van Gaal was not hired last summer to win the FA Cup. He knows he must get United back into the Champions League. No Premier League club with aspirations of winning the league can afford to be locked out of money-spinning European competition for more than the odd season. Similarly, Wenger knows what his true responsibilities are. French centre forward Olivier Giroud is finally looking capable of scoring consistently for the Gunners . On Monday night, however, the expectation is that this should feel like the most important night of these teams\u2019 seasons so far and the contest should benefit from that. Arsenal have been playing reasonably well for some time and have won 10 of their last 11 domestic games. With their French centre forward Olivier Giroud finally looking capable of scoring consistently, the holders will head north knowing they have the capacity to trouble their great rivals. They also have a league defeat from early winter to avenge. Arsene Wenger's side are current FA Cup champions after their dramatic victory against Hull last season . United\u2019s football, on the other hand, has been more patchy but Van Gaal will hope that inspiration can be taken from an away win at Newcastle last Wednesday that had an important feel about it. He will also hope his captain Wayne Rooney can use his own rather sketchy FA Cup past as a motivating factor. \u2018He has not won the FA Cup,\u2019 said Van Gaal. \u2018And that is something that is missing for him. \u2018My first championship with Ajax was very important for me, it was also an emotional thing. It will be the same for Wayne.\u2019",

        "document": "Lukas Podolski's loan spell at Inter Milan has been far from impressive, and the Arsenal man could find himself back in north London come the summer. The 29-year-old German forward was shipped out to Serie A in January but has failed to net on nine occasions for Roberto Mancini's side, and his agent has revealed that a move back to the Emirates could be on the cards. 'Anything could happen,' Ali Pektas told\u00a0Fanatik. 'Last summer he could have moved to Galatasaray, but it never materialised. Every summer Lukas and I go on holiday to Turkey.

'For the moment he's on loan at Inter, and when it ends at the end of the season he could return to Arsenal, where he still has a year on his contract. 'With regard to his future, all I can say is that anything could happen, even a transfer to Turkey. Why not? He appreciates [Turkish football] a lot, and he wants to keep playing at a high level.' Podolski was this week rated as the second-worst Serie A signing of the season in a poll conducted by Gazzetta dello Sport, but he is not fazed by the criticism being levelled at him. The Arsenal loanee falls to the floor under the challenge of Fiorentina defender Gonzalo on Sunday . Podolski battles for a header with Milan Badelj (right) but he has not impressed during his time in Serie A . He told Sport1: You need to swallow [criticism] in professional football. There is always another direction, meaning a positive one. 'I don't care for media or people being critical of me. I know that this is part of the business. It's important to know what you have to do to be better. Podolski was given an opportunity to start Inter's crunch clash with Fiorentina on Sunday, but was hauled off in the second half after another lacklustre performance. A particular low point of the match came when Podolski kicked the flag while taking a corner and miskicked the ball, which failed to reach the penalty area and was intercepted to set up a Fiorentina counter-attack. Podolski was voted Serie A's second worst signing of the season by a poll in Gazzetta dello Sport this week .

        "document": "Her ginormous breasts have already left her barely able to run, but now the 'human barbie' Lacey Wildd has revealed that she is planning a 13th breast enlargement. Indeed, the mother-of-six from West Virginia - wants to enhance her chest to a QQQ cup size, and wants to go under the knife for her 37th operation in a bid to transform her appearance. Not only that, the 46-year-old has been on an extreme diet in a bid to slim down to a tiny size zero. Scroll down for video . Lacey Wildd took a stroll along the breach showing off her newly slimmed down figure, she has revealed she plans to lose more weight and wants her breasts enlarged again . Lacey, who this week showed off her curvaceous body in a tiny bikini, said: 'I feel really good but I still think I need to lose more weight. I want to go down to a size 3 or even a 0. 'I want to have the most extreme body in the world, I want to be a walking cartoon character. But I know I have to be careful.' Lacey had previously been turned down for more surgery by a doctor who told her that she would ruin her body if she made her breasts any larger. However, she vowed to carry on until she found someone who would do the operation for her. Lacey has previously said: 'My world rotates around my boobs. I don't get high when I have surgery. But I do get a little thrill out of thinking I\u2019m going to wake up looking different.' Lacey's breasts are so large that she can only use the back hobs on her oven so she doesn't burn them . Lacy originally started off with breast enhancement surgery but soon moved on to other parts of her body. 'As I got older I got a flatter butt, so I had Brazilian butt lifts to give me more shape. I had three implants at $10,000 a time, so now I've got a $30,000 butt,' she jokes. However her exaggerated curves mean that she finds it difficult to find clothes that actually fit her. Her young daughter Jenaveve is less enthusiastic about her mother's massive embonpoint. 'I can\u2019t go anywhere without people swarming over her,' she complains. As for the boobs themselves: It's disgusting,' she admits. Through the years Lacey has had so much surgery that she is no unrecognisable from her former self - pictured left before her surgery, and right, after her first operations . Lacey has previously stared in the TLC show My Strange Addiction, where she revealed all about her quest to look like Barbie . Lacey - who has been living off a controversial diet of just an apple, lemon juice and water for the past six weeks - has previously spoken out about her desire to look like Barbie. In TLC's My Strange Addiction which filmed about her 36th surgery she said: 'I want to be an adult Barbie, like the extreme Barbie. 'I'm known as one of the most extreme plastic surgery patients in the world and I want to keep pushing the limits.' 'I'm proud to be plastic. I have spent a quarter of a million dollars to build the most extreme plastic body in the world,' she previously said. 'I'm not just obsessed with my boobs,' she added. 'I'm obsessed with the entire look. I'm looking for the perfect body.' Lacey's 36 previous surgeries include 12 boob jobs, liposuction, nose and chin augmentation and she's even had her bum made bigger. The huge weight of her chest - each breast currently weight 21 pounds - means that she has to prop pillows underneath her while driving and she only uses the back burners on her stove in case she burns her breasts while cooking. Lacey has previously revealed that she finds it hard to find clothes that fit her thanks to her giant chest . Lacey has six children however, they are not all happy with her super enhanced assets .",

        "document": "Teacher Kim Davies, pictured, vowed that she would have no problems in being a whistleblower again despite being reprimanded by a watchdog . A teacher who complained about an unruly pupil and went on sick leave was spied upon by the local education authority while she was on sick leave. Kim Davies, who has taught English for the past 28 years, faced the prospect of being hit with a classroom ban following allegations of misconduct. A General Teaching Council For Wales (GTCW) hearing in Cardiff was told Mrs Davies became a thorn in the side of education officials after lodging more than 20 complaints about a colleague and nine to an exam board. The 56-year-old was later followed by a team of private investigators after her dispute with bosses saw her signed off by a doctor on grounds of stress. Caerphilly County Council took the drastic action after suspecting the mother-of-two was defrauding the sickness absence system - but the Information Commissioner's Office later ruled the local authority was wrong to begin the surveillance. However, she was still hauled before the GTCW - who found she had broken confidentiality rules about her disciplinary procedure as well as making 'vexatious' complaints. Among the penalties available to the body included striking Mrs Davies' name from the teaching register - a move she said would have not only cost her job but also her home. A panel decided against the more severe sanctions - and said she can carry on teaching provided she promises not to cause problems again. Mrs Davies denied being a troublemaker and said she was 'fighting injustice' after her complaint about a pupil's behaviour was not taken seriously. She said: 'I am relieved that I am able to carry on teaching. I don't know what I would have done if that was taken from me - it would have had a massive effect on my welfare and happiness as well as my financial circumstances. 'I've been through four years of hell - not only has there been the prospect of losing my home but also my job. 'But despite everything that I have been through it would not put me off on blowing the whistle again. 'This issue unravelled following a complaint about the safety of pupils and staff. It is the job of a teacher to ensure pupils are safe in the classroom. 'I care too much about my pupils and their welfare. 'Even though they decided the allegations against were proven, I always believed what I was doing was right. 'And if you can live with your conscience, then you can survive.' The GTCW heard that Mrs Shaw, from Blackwood, south Wales, became embroiled in a row with bosses at Pontllanfraith Comprehensive School after lodging a complaint about a problem pupil's 'threatening behaviour'. After feeling the issue was not taken seriously, she was subject to disciplinary proceedings in 2010 before finally being dismissed two years later. During her period of suspension, it was found she breached confidentiality rules during the school's internal disciplinary processes and made 'vexatious allegations' to exam board WJEC in an attempt to bring the school into disrepute. Case presenter Lousha Reynolds said the registrant also behaved inappropriately towards her line manager, her head of department and headteacher Robert Davies - whom she called 'an idiot' and referred to him being in his 'ivory tower'. Ms Reynolds added: 'She felt her behaviour was justified because she wanted to make people pay, because she felt a sense of injustice. 'We heard today that she didn't want the education of pupils to be jeopardised, but there is still no insight into her failings. 'She was only suspended because of the way she acted towards her disciplinary proceeding.' Ms Davies had raised issues at\u00a0Pontllanfraith Comprehensive School, pictured, about a 'problem pupil' However, while the row rumbled on it emerged that Caerphilly Council paid private investigators \u00a33,600 to tail Mrs Shaw for three days - a move the Information Commissioner's Office later called 'unlawful'. In mitigation, Mrs Shaw told the GTCW she had been absolutely devastated by the events of the past four years. 'I had built up a reputation over 28 years in one school and to have that questioned and to be accused of malpractice decimated everything I believed I stood for,' she said. NASUWT representative Colin Adkins told the hearing Mrs Shaw believed she was being disciplined after raising 'a serious safeguarding matter'. He said: 'Mrs Shaw believed that was done by challenging her professional integrity, which she found personally devastating. 'She has suffered a serious detriment already - financially and personally - for pursuing matters she believed she was right to pursue. 'I believe the public interest is best served by allowing Mrs Shaw to continue teaching. Quite clearly, she's a good teacher.' Panel chairman Steve Powell said the GTCW was satisfied Mrs Shaw failed to 'behave professionally' during her disciplinary process and her actions 'fell short of what is expected of a registered teacher'. Mrs Shaw, who has been a supply teacher for the past two years, was handed a conditional registration order. It means she can carry on teaching provided she fulfils certain requirements, such as any employer having to submit a report on her progress. Following the decision, she said: 'I'm still trying to take in the implications of what this means but for now I just want to get back doing what I do best - teaching.'",

        "document": "Researchers studying nature have turned to a new frontier they say could be more diverse than anmost anywhere else - homes. They say indoor spaces could be the fastest growing biome, a word used to describe the different realms of life on\u00a0Earth. Researchers estimate that the indoor biome makes up about 0.5 percent of ice-free land, or about 247,000 square miles, almost the size of Texas. The various organisms living in homes and other indoor spaces rarely has been researched, with sparse studies of rodents and German cockroaches, researchers say. A study of 40 houses in North Carolina used genomic technologies to document the inhabitants. It found more than 8,000 bacterial and archaeal taxa. Another study of 50 houses in the same state described more than 750 types of arthropods, including insects and spiders . An examination of 11 houses in California found a great variety of fungus among us. A review paper published March 19 in the journal Trends in Ecology and Evolution serves as a call for research in the emerging field of indoor biome ecology and evolution. The various organisms living in homes and other indoor spaces rarely has been researched, with sparse studies of rodents and German cockroaches, for example, from the pest management field, or public health perspectives on microbes. The paper came out of a 2013 workshop that included the evolutionary biology of the built environment, which included evolutionary, microbial and plant biologists, entomologists, architects, scientists who study better building design, and others. 'People have this picture that there are only a few insect species and microbial species eating human scrap,' said Laura Martin of Cornell, the paper's first author. 'But given the number of species found indoors, it is likely there's a lot more going on that we don't know about.' A study of 40 houses in North Carolina used genomic technologies to document more than 8,000 bacterial and archaeal taxa; another study of 50 houses in the same state described more than 750 types of arthropods, including insects and spiders; and an examination of 11 houses in California found a great variety of fungus among us. Researchers estimate that the indoor biome makes up about 0.5 percent of ice-free land, or about 247,000 square miles, almost the size of Texas. 'I've been noticing more species inside my house since I went to this working group,' Martin said, referring to the 2013 workshop. Co-author Robert Dunn, of North Carolina State University, discovered a species of parasitic wasp that lays its eggs inside cockroaches in his house. 'The radical diversity in abiotic environments, such as in water heaters, freezers and on kitchen counters, is vast and could parallel microclimates found on forest floors,' said Martin. The paper notes that the first human houses date back 20,000 years and that today's indoor environments most closely resemble caves. The emerging field also holds potential for studying rapid evolution, as the development of human-built environments has been recent. Madagascar Hissing Cockroaches: Researchers called for more research into pests, saying the home was an untapped resource. Close up of a bedbug on skin.'People have this picture that there are only a few insect species and microbial species eating human scrap,' said Laura Martin, the paper's first author and a graduate student in the field of natural resources. Researchers say they have many questions regarding the indoor evolution - \u00a0such as whether species found indoors were pre-adapted to indoor environments or whether they have adapted to them; and how the indoors might drive the evolution of new species. They also hope to compare species in Alaska, for example, with species in Texas; whether outdoor environments determine what happens indoors; which indoor species are healthful to have; and how home design can contribute to health and indoor species compositions. 'We are interested in reframing the dialogue away from what gross or dangerous pests live in houses to what biodiversity exists in houses,' Martin said.",

        "document": "A dominatrix based in Scotland is challenging a new law in Northern Ireland that will make it illegal to pay for sex. Laura Lee, 37, believes the legislation will put women's lives in danger by driving prostitution underground. In response, she's assembled a 'crack team' of legal experts to fight the legislation all the way to the European Court of Justice. For the past 18 years, Laura has earned her living as a sex worker, travelling between Scotland and Ireland and juggling the job with motherhood, studying and activism. Laura Lee, 37, has worked in the sex industry for 18 years and believes new legislation will put lives in danger . 'The work I do is very diverse,' Laura said. 'I'm a dominatrix, I provide a \"girlfriend experience\" and I also work with the disabled and terminally ill.' Laura says her clients fall into three categories. 'The first group are what I call my Duracell bunnies,' she said. 'These are the young guys who watch a lot of porn and think that good sex is just how long you can pound away for, which of course it's not. They can be difficult to deal with but they're good fun. 'I see a lot of guys in their 50s who got married at 20 and found the sex died off. It can be because they drifted apart from their wife but, in some cases, it's sadder; the wife may have developed a degenerative condition like Alzheimer's or MS or Parkinson's. 'Sometimes it's on their conscience for a long time before they contact me but they've come to the conclusion that it's better for everybody. Laura says her clients fall into three categories - including 'Duracell bunnies' who 'pound away' Until June 1, laws governing prostitution in Northern Ireland remain similar to the rest of the UK and the Republic of Ireland. This means that prostitution itself is legal, but most activities associated with it (such as soliciting in a public place or running a brothel) are illegal. Once the Human Trafficking and Exploitation Act comes into force, it will be illegal for consenting adults to pay for sex in Northern Ireland. 'The third category are my older guys. They're usually widows, terribly lonely, and they just want cuddles and company more than anything else.' Laura is careful when choosing her clients, ensuring that she's safe and that men are clear about what the session will involve, especially when they're booking her as a dominatrix. 'I get a good grasp before-hand of what they're expecting,' she said. 'We pretty much agree a scenario but part of my job as a dominatrix is encouraging people to push their boundaries. This could be through things like spanking, caning, cross-dressing or role play.' At the moment, transactions like this between Laura and her Northern Irish clients are legal. However, from June 1, a new law will mean that men who pay Laura for sex could be arrested. The legislation is being championed by Democratic Unionist peer Lord Morrow. It will make Northern Ireland the first region in the UK to ban payment for sex between consenting adults. Laura says she is a dominatrix providing a 'girlfriend experience' The so-called 'Swedish model' \u2013 which makes it illegal to buy sex, but not to sell it \u2013 has been heavily criticised by groups including the World Health Organisation and Amnesty International. They say there's no evidence it works and that, instead, it causes real harm to women. Police in Northern Ireland are not backing the legislation and the justice minister, David Ford, has said to will be hard to enforce. Importantly, a Department of Justice commissioned survey revealed that 98 per cent of sex workers are opposed to the law. 'Even women who've suffered terribly within the trade agreed that sometimes what's needed is refuge and rehab not the criminalisation of clients,' Laura said. The law is being brought in as a solution to sex trafficking, although the Department of Justice report suggested that less than 1 percent of those involved in the sex trade had been forced into it. Last year, there were no recorded incidents of sex trafficking in Northern Ireland but there were 70 recorded incidences of violence against sex workers. Laura is worried this violence is about to increase as women are forced to work in more isolated areas and clients refuse to give out personal details over fear of arrest. The main fear is of an increase in violence and vulnerability\u00a0as women are forced to work in more isolated areas and clients refuse to give out personal details over fear of arrest . 'Lord Morrow has effectively said that he really couldn't care less about the welfare of sex workers,' she said. Once the law comes in, the crusading dominatrix and her team of expert lawyers will take their case first to Northern Ireland's High Court and finally to the European court of human rights. The team will challenge the legislation on several articles. They are hoping to prove that Lord Morrow's law contravenes the European Convention on Human Rights, including the rights to privacy, health and protection from degrading treatment. The law may even flout the human right to life. If prostitution becomes more hidden and dangerous, Laura has no doubt that deaths will follow. 'Sex workers are going to suffer,' she said. 'I witnessed the effects of the 1993 legislation when I was working in Dublin. As soon as legislation came in making it an offence to solicit, violence against sex workers skyrocketed and it wasn't too long before [21-year-old sex worker] Sinead Kelly was stabbed to death by a client.' Last year, a similar law was proposed in the UK by MP Fiona Mactaggart. But after a campaign by the English collective of Prostitutes (ECP), the Sex Worker Open University and the Women's Institute the bill was dropped without even going to a vote. Laura Watson of the ECP said they are behind Laura Lee's fight in Northern Ireland. 'Internationally, sex workers are challenging discriminatory prostitution laws which force us to work in isolation and increased danger,' she said. 'Legal challenges, spearheaded by sex workers, are a vital tool in our armoury to win justice and protection.'",

        "document": "Rachel Hollis, a married mother of three, was vacationing in Mexico this weekend when she decided to do something for all the moms out there: pose in her bikini on the beach, proudly flaunting her post-pregnancy body. Hollis, 32, a Los Angeles celebrity party planner and the founder of the lifestyle website The Chic Site, on Saturday shared the snapshot on the Facebook page for her business, accompanied by a strong message of empowerment. \u2018I have stretch marks and I wear a bikini. I have a belly that's permanently flabby from carrying three giant babies and I wear a bikini. My belly button is saggy... (which is something I didn't even know was possible before!!) and I wear a bikini,\u2019 she wrote in her brief manifesto. If you got it, flaunt it: Party planner and married mother of three Rachel Hollis, 32, became a viral sensation this weekend after she posted this bold bikini photo showing off her post-pregnancy body . Proud mom: Hollis has three sons, ages 2, 6 and 8, with her husband of 11 years, David (far left) On the run: Hollis said a week before her now-famous beach photo was taken, she had completed her first marathon (left), and she felt that she was at the peak of her form . \u2018I wear a bikini because I'm proud of this body and every mark on it. Those marks prove that I was blessed enough to carry my babies and that flabby tummy means I worked hard to lose what weight I could. \u2018I wear a bikini because the only man who's opinion matters knows what I went through to look this way. That same man says he's never seen anything sexier than my body, marks and all. \u2018They aren't scars ladies, they're stripes and you've earned them. Flaunt that body with pride!' The reaction to Hollis\u2019 inspiring post was almost instant: by Tuesday evening it has drawn more than 341,000 'likes' and more than 10,000 comments, many of them from fellow mothers thanking Hollis for taking a stand against body-shaming and speaking out on their behalf. In an interview with Yahoo Parenting, Hollis explained that she was vacationing with her husband of 11 years, David, in Cancun when she asked him to take a picture of her in a two-piece orange and blue monogrammed swimsuit. When she took a look at the resulting image, Hollis said she noticed the stretch marks on her stomach and released that she has never seen such a candid snapshot on social media. 'So I thought, \"I'll just post this for the moms,\"' she recalled. No more shame: The 32-year-old married mother of three said she decided to share her bikini photo to give confidence to other moms . Battle of the bulge: The Oklahoma native said she has been struggling with weight her entire life . Family matters: When Hollis became pregnant with her first child, she packed on 45lbs, which she was unable to lose by her second pregnancy . Before long, comments and 'likes' began pouring in, leaving Hollis feeling overwhelmed with support. 'You have no idea of how empowering your words are to someone as myself. I gave birth to my last baby (my third son) 6 months ago. I have many stretch marks... and my confidence has plummeted. Reading this has made me realize how im seeing everything in the wrong way,' wrote Amanda Gongloff, thanking Hollis for helping her regain her lost self-confidence. Amanda Uscanga wrote in a similar vain: 'Thank you for sharing this! Finally another woman who's stomach that looks like mine.' 'Us 50 somethings are proud of our children ( and grandchildren) but ashamed of our bodies. God blessed us to bear children. The media cursed us with untrue body image. We are all beautiful because if Gods grace. My body will be in a bikini. Just bought it yesterday!\u2019 Pam field-Mackle posted. Some of Hollis' followers went a step further, sharing on her page their own bikini snapshots, with stretch marks and all. For his eyes only: The 32-year-old party planner wrote in her Facebook manifesto that the only man whose opinion she cares about is her husband, David, and he thinks she looks sexy . Positive feedback: Hollis' photo has drawn thousands of comments from other moms, some of whom even shared 'imperfect' bikini photos of their own . Third time's the charm: after she gave birth to her third son (pictured), Hollis was finally able to get back to her pre-pregnancy weight through healthy eating and exercise . Nancy Engelhard uploaded a photo of herself in a black two-piece number on the beach, along with a caption that boldly stated: 'This is me! After 2 kids, 1 miscarriage, 7 bladder surgeries, ovarian cancer and a hysterectomy! Love my bikini! A few male commenters also weighed in, among them disabled veteran Mike Vanderveen who revealed that he still wears shorts, even though he had lost his legs in a land mine explosion. 'At least I don't have to worry about snakebites, cold feet, stubbing my toes, twisting my ankles, and buying shoes is a breeze,' he joked, before concluding in all caps: 'IF YOU DON\u2019T LIKE WHAT YOU SEE, LOOK THE OTHER WAY!!!' Hollis responded to the veteran\u2019s message by saying that at age 22, she had a bout with a condition called Bell's Palsy, which left her face paralyzed for two months. Not everyone, however, got on board with her positive body image message, with some users lambasting her for drawing attention to such a relatively minor problem as stretch marks. The mother of three, however, insisted that her critics missed the point of her message. Party girl: Hollis, pictured all dressed up alongside her spouse, launched her party-planning business in LA back in 2004 . Playing dress-up: The Hollis clan on Halloween, channeling an Old West town, with Rachel dressed as a flowering cactus and her youngest son dressed as a tumbleweed . Hollis, the daughter of an Oklahoma Pentecostal minister and a church pianist, said she has been fighting the battle of the bulge her entire life, even before she had her three sons, ages 2, 6 and 8. While she was pregnant with her first child, the 5-foot-2 Hollis packed on 45lbs, and she had not lost that weight by the time she became pregnant with her second son. After giving birth to her youngest, Hollis was finally able to get back to her pre-pregnancy weight through healthy eating and exercise. Hollis revealed to Today Show that the now-famous beach photo was taken a week after she had completed her first marathon and was proud of her new and improved physique. 'It\u2019s never ever going to be like a Victoria\u2019s Secret model, but I think I look good and my husband wants to make out with me, so I\u2019m doing something right,' Hollis concluded.",

        "document": "(CNN)One is a former high school cornerback who also loves baseball. The other is a football  fan who also played competitive golf. The two University of Oklahoma students at the center of a racist fraternity video have more than sports in common. They're both under fire since the nine-second clip showed them making racial slurs against blacks. In it, students at the now-disbanded Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity clap, pump their fists and laugh as they hurl racial slurs and make a reference to lynching. School officials have expelled Parker Rice and Levi Pettit because of their alleged \"leadership role\" in the racist chant. Here's what we know about the two students: . Rice, 19,  was raised in Dallas, where he recently graduated  from Jesuit College Preparatory School. In high school, he was an avid sportsman, and he played cornerback on the football team, in addition to baseball, The Dallas Morning News reported. His father, Bob Rice, is a real estate agent in Dallas, where he volunteers for various organizations, including a baseball league and the local YMCA, according to the newspaper. Earlier this year, a sibling of the younger Rice described their close relationship in an interview with their high school newspaper. In the article, the brother says they enjoy playing video games and watching movies together. Rice has apologized for the video, calling his actions wrong and reckless. \"I made a horrible mistake by joining into the singing and encouraging others to do the same,\" he said in a statement Tuesday. His family has fled their home, where protesters gathered Wednesday. They've also wiped out their social media accounts. As the university tries to heal after days of controversy, some are rallying to Rice's defense. Matthew Lopez,  a friend and fellow student at the university, said the video is not a reflection of who he is. \"That video does not represent his core personality,\" Lopez said. \"Unfortunately though, as things are, that might define him for a while. But it does not define him personally, I feel.\" Lopez described him as a \"charismatic, good person, with a good soul and a good spirit\" who experienced a lapse in judgment. \"His behavior is a result of his influence of the fraternity system and the traditions that have been embedded since pre-civil war times, when the fraternity was made, which obviously weren't the most tolerant times,\" Lopez said. The second student expelled, Pettit does not have much of a digital footprint. What appears to be his now deleted Twitter page mainly focuses on his musings about college football. Pettit played golf at his alma mater, Highland Park High School, The Dallas Morning News reported. In a statement, his parents said their son made a horrible mistake and apologized to African-Americans, students and university faculty. \"He is a good boy, but what we saw in those videos is disgusting,\" Brody and Susan Pettit said. \"While it may be difficult for those who only know Levi from the video to understand, we know his heart, and he is not a racist.\" CNN has reached out to both students but has not heard back from Rice. A spokesman for the Pettit family declined CNN's request for an interview.",

        "document": "A fishing guide who was accused of hurling abuse at his clients and defecating off the front of the boat has hit back at allegations made by disgruntled customers. Manager Allan Beale of Darwin\u2019s Barra Base has been slammed over his alleged behaviour on the Australian travel website Trip Advisor. One client, under the name \u2018robrobbo\u2019 from Brisbane has penned his fishing safari experience with Beale as \u2018so bad it was great\u2019 after staying at the lodge with four other friends in February last year. Manager Allan Beale (left) of Darwin\u2019s Barra Base has been running his business for more than 12 years . \u2018Once we hit the water with Allan I think we were all looking around for the hidden cameras!\u2019 the post read. \u2018Abused at the boat ramp whilst attempting to help him launch the boat, abused when we hooked a fish, abused when we lost a fish, witnesses to the man himself defecating off the front of the boat\u2026\u2019 In response to these allegations, Beale told Daily Mail Australia the review was not true and are based on \u2018one side of exaggeration\u2019. \u2018The reviews were pretty rude and distorted to the facts,\u2019 Beale said. \u2018Customer service is our business. We've been in the tourism business for more than 12 years and I'm saddened to read these false allegations after all these years.' Beale said the allegation was not true and are based on \u2018one side of exaggeration\u2019 - he also added that 'catfish are a pest' so he 'assists to minimise the population' Beale said fishing safari offers a great experience to all customers as well as meet client's best interests . Beale said one person had suffered a sore back during this trip so he suggested an alternative because the man couldn't handle the rough waves and everyone was happy to choose the other location for fish species . Another client, under the name \u2018Les N\u2019 from Perth also took to the travel website to post their \u2018overrated and disappointing\u2019 experience. \u2018I wrote a review on Alan's Facebook account after he used pictures of my group holding fish up that quite frankly I couldn't believe we kept?\u2019 the post read. \u2018We came here to catch sailfish & Barra? What a joke, not one sailfish and 3 barra, not one was a keeper, we paid nearly $4000 and didn't take a fish home, great.' Beale, who runs the fishing safari, said customer service plays an important role in his tourism business . A 152cm Black Jewfish landed Finniss River 17th June 2013 by Gary Bez from Karratha at head . But Beale told Daily Mail Australia they had set off for Sail City to go hunting for sailfish but one person among the group had suffered a sore back during the trip. \u2018One of the chaps had a sore back and he couldn\u2019t handle the wave action so I told them that we couldn\u2019t go out there because we needed to look after the client\u2019s best interest,\u2019 Beale said. 'I like to make 100 percent of my customers happy but when it comes to bad weather and body conditions, the reality is - it\u2019s hard to give them that because we can\u2019t control the weather. \u2018I knew the wave action from the wind would double in the next two hours and the sailfish would have been around 60 kilometres away so it was definitely out of the question. \u2018I explained it to them and they accepted that they couldn\u2019t handle the distance so I gave them two safer alternatives \u2013 go black jewfish fishing at Peron Island or travel out to Jenny and Blaze Wide for Spanish Mackerel \u2013 everyone picked the Spanish Mackerel. \u2018I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to make these sorts of allegations towards our business because all we can do is offer the best service as possible.' Beale said fishing safari offers a great experience to all customers as well as meet client's best interests . Beale, who runs the fishing safari, said customer service plays an important role in his tourism business . Darwins Barra Base will offer their clients the choice of Two Levels of Extended Fishing Safaris . Les N added: \u2018Alan was the skipper the 1st day, what a miserable moany [sic] guy, all he did all day was tell us how much he was struggling to keep skippers & that his secretary was on stress leave. \u2018Sorry mate we needed counciling [sic] after listening to your moaning all day,\u2019 the post continued. But Beale responded: \u2018During the day clients ask questions whilst fishing about work, fishing, staff and family and their business. This comment about me moaning about staff issues just shows how little he had to go to, to complain. \u2018There are issues in these allegations \u2013 they are made up and completely false. \u2018And as for the defecation claims \u2013 I never defecated and they are pure lies. \u2018We don\u2019t have commercial toilets. The truth of matter is, if someone has to go, then we have to go but you've got to do it in a safe matter.\u2019 Beale added: \u2018Send us an email and I'll look after you and ensure all the little issues presented in these reviews are better handled for you by me and my staff.\u2019 For more information, please visit darwinbarrabase.com.au.",

        "document": "This mother of five has never been in labour for more than two hours - and she remarkably manages to beat her delivery record every time she gives birth. Mary Gorgens, who has never been given much warning before she goes into labour, has continued her stretch of speedy deliveries giving birth to her latest child in just two minutes. Even though the 35-year-old from Sydney has earned herself a\u00a0reputation\u00a0of rapid-fire births, nothing could have prepared her for the latest delivery on January 30. Mary Gorgens, 35, was given just two minutes warning before she gave birth to her son Brody  on the floor of her Sydney bedroom on January 30 . Rapid fire births: Mary and Simon Gorgens have had five children (Ava, Mila, Brody, Max and Sienna) and all births have been quicker than the last . Ms Gorgens went to the toilet in the early hours of the morning after feeling a slight twinge but had to quickly 'waddle' back to the bedroom when she felt her son's head starting to come out. She woke her husband Simon who stumbled to the bathroom thinking he had some time. When he came back, the 40-year-old found his wife on all fours and two minutes later he was holding his son Brody in his arms. 'I had no inkling, no feeling, no pain. He was two days early, I really wasn't expecting it that day,' Ms Gorgens told Daily Mail Australia. Luckily, the Gorgen family are used to these rapid-fire births. When she gave birth to their first child Max in December 2008, Ms Gorgens made it to the hospital with just 12 minutes to spare. The couple's eldest son Max was born in December 2008. It took just two hours from the time Mary felt the first twinge and they made it to the hospital with just 12 minutes to spare . It took 90 minutes for baby Ava to arrive in August 2010 when she was born on the way to the hospital. She was still in her amniotic sack and the midwife found her inside her mother's pants . 'I wasn't even sure I was in labour. I called my husband and then the pain came really quickly. By the time he got home I was ready to push and I could feel the head,' she said. 'We waddled up to maternity and they ran out \u2013 I was screaming at that point. They rushed me into delivery and threw me up on to the bed. 'One push and the head was out and one more and then his body came out. We got to the hospital at 10.22am and Max was born at 10.34am.' It took two hours for Max to be born from the time Ms Gorgens felt the first twinge. 'The next two were born in the car and the other two at home,' she said. 'I haven't had any pain relief in any birth because there hasn't been enough time.' The couple's second child Ava was born in 90 minutes in August 2010. Sienna was born in December 2011 when her dad pulled onto a median strip en route to the hospital. Mary was 50 minutes into labour when Ava arrived . Mary and Simon didn't even make it to the car when Mila was born in March 2013. The couple were given 10 minutes warning before the baby popped out on the bedroom floor . Mary went to the toilet  after feeling a slight twinge but had to quickly 'waddle' back to the bedroom when she felt her son's head starting to come out. Her son Brody was born just two minutes later in her bedroom . 'My hubby got home again and I already felt like I needed to push. We got in the car but I told him I didn't think we would make it,' she said. 'She was born at some point along the way, but she was still in her amniotic sack. 'I was fully clothed and she slipped past everything I was wearing... even my underwear. It was very bizzare.' The midwife who met them at the hospital pulled Ms Gorgens' pants down in the car and she found baby Ava. 'We couldn't hear her because she was still in her sack. I was a little scared to look because we couldn't hear crying,' she said. 'She was perfectly okay - Simon cut the cord when we were still in the car.' When it came to Sienna's birth in December 2011, the couple attempted the hospital dash again. 'Simon managed to stop on the median strip, he ran to my side and her head was already coming out,' Ms Gorgens said. 'He grabbed her and delivered her... then we rushed to the hospital again. Sienna only took 50 minutes.' Mary hasn't had pain relief in any of her five births because there hasn't been enough time . Simon has delivered the three youngest children because they couldn't make it to the hospital in time . Mila, Ava, Brody, Max and Sienna (L-R) were all born healthy despite only the eldest being born in the hospital . But the couple's fourth child was considerably quicker and they didn't even made it to the car. 'Mila was born on our bedroom floor in 10 minutes,' Ms Gorgens said. 'It was at night in March 2013 and I had just finished cooking - everything was fine. I had seen the midwife that day and she said any time now. 'I put the two girls to bed and Max was still getting ready. I started pacing in our bedroom and all of a sudden it just ramped up.' She screamed out for her husband to grab some towels and the couple had to lock themselves in their bedroom so their four-year-old son wouldn't see. 'I got on all fours and pushed. Sienna was still in her sack as well and Simon had to break it with his fingers as he guided her out. He wasn't even sure what he was supposed to do.' Mary has never been given much warning when she goes into labour but even she couldn't be prepared for Brody's rapid-fire birth in January . The couple aren't looking to have more children right now and they don't think they could beat the record . Ms Gorgens hasn't had pain relief in any of her five births because there hasn't been enough time. 'I don't have pains for hours on end beforehand. It's intense for a short amount of time. It's pretty crazy. I've had five go that way and they have all been quicker than the last. 'My friends joke that I could sneeze and a baby would pop out.' The mother of five considers herself extremely lucky with some of her friends going through 40 hours labours. 'I'm lucky because even though we weren't in hospital, at the end of the day they went smoothly and they were all healthy. 'It's amazing what your body can do.' The couple aren't looking to have more children right now, but aren't prepared to close the door just yet. 'I definitely don't think I could (deliver) any faster though,' Ms Gorgens said.",

The micro-pig, who goes by the name of Frances Bacon, eats, sleeps and drinks at the Conquering Hero in south London. But the four-year-old soon started polishing off the dregs from customers' discarded beer glasses and breaking into the bar's snack supply. Frances Bacon the pig, pictured with her owners Ian and Vicky Taylor-Ross, has been banned from her local pub after stealing pints and headbutting customers . The micro-pig eats, sleeps and drinks at her owner's inn, the Conquering Hero in West Norwood, London . But she soon started finishing off the dregs from discarded beer glasses and helping herself to the pork scratchings . The pig has a penchant for pork scratchings - but 'doesn't have a clue that between pork scratchings are her relatives', according to Mrs Taylor-Ross . Customers at the West Norwood establishment had also started letting the Vietnamese Pot-Belly take a sip from their beer or cider. The pig, who must be kept on a strictly vegetarian diet, even recently broke into the bar and ate a big bag of dry-roasted peanuts, making her thirsty for days. Landlords Ian and Vicky Taylor-Ross only realised what was going on when the animal - who has her own space in the beer garden - started headbutting customers in the legs. The couple has now warned customers not to serve the pig any alcohol in a bid to help  clamp down on her drinking. They have also had to put their pork scratchings, crisps and peanuts on a higher shelf under lock and key in case Frances attempts to snuffle them. Mr Taylor-Ross, 43, said Frances has become a bit of a 'loveable menace.'

But we're keeping a closer eye on her now and that won't happen again.' Mrs Taylor-Ross added: 'We have had to put locks on the bar to stop her coming in and stealing crisps and scratchings. She has got an incredible sense of smell. 'She eats a special dry feed for micro-pigs and eats all our vegetable peelings - as long as she's not eating her relatives it's OK.

        "document": "(CNN)My name is Mark Goodacre, and I am a professor of New Testament and Christian origins in the Department of Religious Studies at Duke University. I was series adviser and one of many on-camera experts on CNN's \"Finding Jesus,\" which airs on Sundays. I also appear in each episode of the program. Viewers were invited to tweet and post their questions on the \"Finding Jesus\" Facebook page during the latest episode, \"The Gospel of Judas.\" Below are some of the most interesting, and my answers to them. They have been edited for style and clarity for this article: . Yalanda M. Price: What do scholars know about the man named Judas? What is his story? Mark Goodacre: Judas is actually a pretty mysterious figure in the New Testament. In fact, the relative lack of information about him in the Gospels has provided the invitation, across the centuries, for people to speculate about who he was and what could have possibly motivated him to hand Jesus over to the authorities. We know very little about his back story from the Gospels. He appears in the list of 12 disciples called by Jesus, but does not become a main character in the drama until the Passion Narratives. In John's Gospel, he is the disciple who is concerned about Mary wasting money anointing Jesus (John 12.4-6). Soon afterward, he is arranging to hand Jesus over to the authorities. His story ends with his dramatic suicide (Matthew 27.3-10), and Luke tells us that his stomach burst open and his intestines gushed out when he died (Acts 1.18-19). Mark Goodacre answers your questions about the Shroud of Turin . Kristine Spillman Adams: My understanding was always that Judas betrayed Jesus not because he was a villain, but he thought Jesus would start an earthly war when arrested. He was trying to get Jesus to establish a literal, physical kingdom on Earth. Goodacre: This is one of the great mysteries of the last week of Jesus' life. What motivated Judas to betray Jesus? John hints that it was financial greed (John 12.6), and Matthew says that he betrayed Jesus for \"thirty pieces of silver\" (Matthew 27.14-15). It is true, though, that many have speculated that Judas may have been some kind of zealot or freedom fighter, and he has often been depicted in this way in film and fiction. With this theory, he was trying to force Jesus' hand. It has sometimes been said that perhaps the word \"Iscariot\" is a corruption of the word \"sicarii,\" which means \"dagger bearer,\" and that would provide some backing to that theory. However, John identifies Judas as \"Son of Simon Iscariot\", which makes the \"sicarii\" theory less likely. In the end, we may have to accept that we simply will never know the answer to the question about Judas' motivation. Candida Moss answers your questions about John the Baptist . Betsy Wilson-Roark: Are you confident that you now have all of the pages and the current translation is accurate? Are there still words or phrases that are missing or ambiguous? Goodacre: That's a good question. Well, we probably have as much of the Gospel of Judas as we will ever have. Several additional fragments of the Codex Tchacos, in which the Gospel of Judas is featured, came to light after Bruce Ferrini, the dealer who owned the codex for some time, went bankrupt. Now, it is estimated that we have something like 90% to 95% of the text. With regards to translation and interpretation, this process will continue for years to come, as it always does with newly discovered ancient texts. I think the original translators in 2006 did a sterling job, all the more so as they were working with an incomplete, damaged and very complex Coptic text that had been lost for centuries. But I also greatly admire April DeConick's important contribution and the key adjustments in our understanding of the Gospel that this has brought about. I was delighted to see both the earlier and the newer interpretations of the Gospel of Judas dramatized so effectively in \"Finding Jesus.\" Amarylis Didley West: Is there a place that we can find and read the Gospel of Judas? Goodacre: The National Geographic website on the Gospel of Judas does feature the original translation from 2006. As far as I am aware, there is no online version of the newer edition featuring the newer fragments and the revised translation. Watch the latest episode anytime on CNNgo . NJ Robinson: Good question would be did Jesus know Judas would betray him when/before he chose him? Goodacre: The Gospel writers themselves single out Judas as the one who would betray Jesus (more accurately \"hand him over\") as soon as they introduce him (e.g. Mark 3.19), but they, of course, are writing with the benefit of hindsight. We can only guess as to what was in the mind of the historical Jesus. Our lack of knowledge about this and many other aspects in the life of the historical Jesus are what makes the story so compelling for writers of historical fiction. If you would like to read more about Judas, a good starting point is provided in this article on the Society of Biblical Literature's Bible Odyssey website.  It is written by \"Finding Jesus\" contributor Bruce Chilton. And if you would like to read more about the Gospel of Judas, \"Finding Jesus\" contributor April DeConick discusses it on Bible Odyssey.

The brains behind the Ship Your Enemies Glitter business left his mum speechless after she was blindfolded and driven 40 minutes to the car yard for the amazing surprise. The 23-year-old's mum had been relying on family and friends to drive her to and from work after her car broke down three months ago and she couldn't afford to get it fixed. Scroll down for video . Mathew Carpenter's mum (right) was\u00a0blindfolded and driven 40 minutes to the car yard for the surprise . His mother had no idea where she was or what was in store as she was led over to the car . The group arrives at a car dealership where a pink Mitsubishi complete with a huge matching pink bow adorned with white balloons awaits . The footage shows his mother blindfolded in the front seat of the car throughout the 40-minute trip. With a glass of wine in hand, she gets into the spirit by grooving to the music on the radio. 'Mum, where do you think you are right now?' Mathew asks. 'I have no idea,' she replies. 'Do you know where we're going?' 'Nup,' says Ms Carpenter, making dance moves in her seat. 'She's drunk,' a female voice can be heard to say. The group arrives at a car dealership where a pink Mitsubishi complete with a huge matching pink bow adorned with white balloons awaits. She couldn't believe her eyes when she saw her first ever brand new car in front of her . Difficult to grasp what was happening, his mother silently walked over to the car . As she is guided by her daughter to the car she comments that it: 'it feels like we have gone around in a circle' when Mathew confirms that she had. He then says 'mum take your blindfold off' which she does and turns away after being blinded by the sunlight. Mathew goes on to proudly announce the generous gift: 'mum this is your brand new car.' His mother managed to say 'oh my god' in between her jaw dropping to the floor and clapping her hands in delight. Difficult to grasp what was happening, she silently walked to the car. She slowly gets in the pink vehicle and looked around in a state of shock when Mathew asked her if she liked his kind deed. 'Oh my god it's amazing,' she eventually said looking in awe at her first ever brand new car.

        "document": "Peacock tails may be hard to miss, but humans are unaware of the noise created by the bird's pretty plumage. Scientists have shown that peacocks shake their tails to make a noise that is too low for us to hear. Male birds may make the infrared rumble to scare off an approaching rival or to attract a mate. Scientists have shown that peacocks shake their tails when displaying (stock image) to make a noise that is too low for us to hear. Male birds may make the infrared rumble to scare off an approaching rival or to attract a mate across dusty scrub land, the study claims . Researchers at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada, have shown that the birds make infrasound noises - below 20 hertz - using their tails and that other peacocks respond to them. Most humans hear noises between 20 and 20,000 hertz. Dr James Hare noticed a peacock displaying and shaking its tail at a wall in a zoo, which he noted looked like a satellite dish and made him question whether the bird was listening to itself, BBC Earth reported. This sparked a study, leading him and graduate student Angela Freeman to record the sound of 46 peacocks shaking their feathers while displaying. Male and female peacocks became more alert and moved around when the low noises were played back to them by researchers, with males (stock image) shrieking out . Charles Darwin first suggested that a peacock\u2019s train serves to attract females and studies have since shown that females tend to prefer males with the most exaggerated male characteristics. Amotz Zahavi said the train indicates a male\u2019s fitness. Males with impressive trains have been shown to be healthier, suggesting that the ornament indicates a male\u2019s ability to survive. His \u2018handicap principle\u2019 says that since males with particularly brightly coloured or large plumes will attract the attention of predators, they must be extra fit to survive. Females are thought to choose mates with good genes, so males with more exaggerated sexual characteristics, such as a big train, tend to have better genes in a peahen\u2019s eyes. Marion Petrie tested whether the displays signal a male\u2019s generic quality by studying a feral population of peafowl in Whipsnade Wildlife Park in England. She found the number of eyespots in the train predicted a male's mating success and that she could manipulate a male\u2019s chances of mating success by cutting off some of his eyespot tail feathers. In the experiment, females lost interest in pruned males and became attracted to untrimmed ones. Furthermore, chicks fathered by males with impressive trains weighed more than those sired by less ornamented birds. Humans hear a rustling sound when this happens, but the experts found that the birds hear a loud sound of between 70 and 108 decibels, according to the study published in the journal Animal Behaviour. Male and female peacocks became more alert and moved around when the low noises were played back to them by researchers, with males shrieking out in response. Experts are unsure how the birds detect infrasound, but know that some can feel vibration through their legs. Ms Freeman said that the birds may simply hear the noises through their ears, the inner part of which seems to be the right shape to detect very low noises. Other animals, such as elephants, have long been known to produce such infrasound, which humans can\u2019t hear. And although a type of grouse called the capercaillie produces infrasound, it seemingly doesn't use it to communicate, meaning that the bird either can\u2019t hear it itself or they just doesn't care about it. Ms Freeman believes that male peacocks may use infrasound to maintain their territory and warn off approaching rivals. But the noises could also be a way of attracting a mate. She observed that male peacocks were most likely to make the low sounds when they showed off their train feathers, producing two displays which she called the \u2018shiver train\u2019 and the \u2018pulse train\u2019. The shiver train is produced by vibration of the train feathers from the centre feathers to the outside of the array and is used by males when females are far away. Ms Freeman believes that male peacocks may use infrasound to maintain their territory and warn off approaching rivals. But the noises could also be a way of attracting a mate. Here, a male displays for a brown, female peahen, hoping she will be impressed by his show of strength . The pulse train is produced by a vibration emanating from the base of all the train feathers and it is used when the female is nearby. Peacocks\u2019 tails are a sign of strength and good genes, so a strong noise may reinforce a message of virility, Ms Freeman said. This could be especially useful as the birds live in scrubby woodland, where high noises can only travel over short distances and birds sometimes can\u2019t see each other. \u2018We think that possibly these signals could signal to females and males who are out of sight behind a bush or over the hill,\u2019 she added.",

        "document": "Most afternoons I can be found huffing and puffing my way up Primrose Hill in North London, pushing what feels like the world's heaviest baby in a buggy. The view of the city from the top is spectacular but for a few precious days I swapped it for an even better one - with the magnificent backdrop of the Italian Dolomites. After a two-hour car journey from Innsbruck we were greeted at Rosa Alpina - a five-star, family-owned hotel and spa tucked in a valley in the tiny village of San Cassiano - with a local speciality: a sweet and comforting hot apple juice. Impossibly neat: Rosa Alpina is nestled in the green foothills of the Italian Dolomites . In the sunshine, the village looked pristine, with pretty wooden chalets stacked against mountain pastures which would have been snow-covered in winter but were now a vivid green. The grass was impossibly neat and as I wondered how many cows it must take to maintain, I spotted sit-on mowers weaving up and down the slopes. Completing the alpine scene was a hefty-looking herd with jangling cowbells. Having picked out a buggy from the hotel lobby, with map in hand we set off on a mountain walk but took the lazy way up - in a cable car. As the cable car lurched, my four month-old daughter Romilly wobbled in my lap, lip trembling; looking back down the mountain and up to the peak seemed a long way off. I began to doubt my fitness for what was my first post-baby trip away - billed as a Yummy Mummy healthy strolling break. I had feared craggy paths at the summit, precariously winding round the mountain, but found gentle, undulating trails. There was a restaurant, playground, park and fountain. It was as family friendly as the nursery department at John Lewis. Families and groups were starting out or finishing walks, with children in backpacks and buggies, or just jogging alongside their parents, perfectly content without a gadget in sight. Some were Nordic walking, others speed hiking. Would this sort of family outing happen back home? Not likely and what a shame. Instead of craggy, unforgiving trails, Sarah found undulating trails in the mountains perfect for buggies . The views were awesome and the air so pure I took in great gulps in the hope it might benefit my London-worn lungs. We could have easily taken a different trail each day of the week. At one hilltop restaurant, deckchairs overlooked the spectacular view like a sort of mountain beach, and children played on swings. For a different view of the mountains, the larch trail runs through meadows and up into the mountains opposite the hotel. It makes for a wonderful outing for energetic children (and their parents) and Rosa Alpina has produced a brilliant educational booklet which encourages little ones to look out for flora and fauna, plus answer questions on their surroundings. Sarah and her\u00a0four month-old daughter Romilly enjoy the alpine views from the cable car . Tucked up inside at Rosa Alpina, the rooms were wonderfully warm - all sweet-smelling pine and herringbone fabrics - but come dusk it was far too tempting to resist lighting the wood fire. Perhaps it was the mountain air, but bedtime passed without a murmur from Romilly, who was spoilt with a beautifully made-up cot and goodie bag including baby slippers, towelling robe and a cuddly bear. Adults get treats too - of the culinary variety. Rosa Alpina boasts St Hubertus, a stunning Michelin-starred restaurant, where chef Norbert Niederkofler uses seasonal vegetables (no tomatoes in winter) and 90 per cent local produce. Romilly and I sank into a neat routine: a walk after breakfast, a swim after lunch. The peace was enough to move me to tears. For my daughter to experience so little intrusive sound apart from cockerels, cowbells and church bells was bliss. My ideal partner (apart from my partner) on the trip would have been my mother. The walks here are challenging enough to invigorate but easy enough to be a comfortable, Clare Balding-type ramble. I began to wonder if Romilly would grow up craving a life of outdoor activities, of escaping and exploring. As a quote from Fred Astaire painted on the wall of the pool said: 'Old age is like everything else - to have success in it you have to start young.' Rosa Alpina (rosalpina.it) offers double rooms from \u00a3235 per night including breakfast. EasyJet (easyjet.com) flies from Gatwick to Innsbruck with one-way fares from \u00a328.99.",

The Blues carry a 1-1 first-leg score into the game at Stamford Bridge after Courtois pulled off a succession of impressive saves at the Parc des Princes, which included denying the Sweden striker with a late stop. The 22-year-old remains confident of keeping out the former Juventus and Barcelona forward again as Jose Mourinho's in-form side chase a treble in the manager's second spell in west London.

I know he's a great striker, and that it's always difficult to stop him, but we have to do that if we want to go through.' 'We're confident, but we expect a very difficult game. Paris are going to come here to score goals. It'll be a very complicated game. We're ready, and we hope to win in front of our fans. We'll have to see the tactics the coach puts in place. What is certain is that we cannot sit back and wait. 'We have to defend well, but we mustn't go for the 0-0 because if we concede a goal, Paris will qualify by winning 1-0. We have to play to our strengths by trying to score goals and win the game.' Chelsea team-mates congratulate Courtois after another impressive performance against West Ham . Ibrahimovic scores from the penalty spot in PSG's 4-1 victory over Lens at the weekend . Courtois added: 'As we're playing at home and we drew 1-1 in the first leg, we're slight favourites. But with the team that Paris has, they also have a lot of hope. It's going to be a very close match. The small details will decide who goes through.' The Premier League leaders required a late goal by Demba Ba to eliminate the big spending French side at the quarter-final stage last season, but are arguably a better team this term. Nonetheless, Courtois is fully aware of the threat posed by the expensively assembled Ligue 1 champions. A late Demba Ba goal eliminated the French side at the Champions League quarter-final stage last season . Ibrahimovic will be playing on the same side as former Chelsea defender David Luiz (right) this time around . 'They're a team that can reach the final. To play them in the last 16 is very early in the competition. But that's the way it is,' he said. 'It's going to be a hotly contested game. Paris are a strong team. We're going to have to be very careful because we mustn't lose. 'If you play for a team like Chelsea, Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich or PSG, the aim is always to win the Champions League. After that, it depends on the circumstances, the opponents you are drawn against. The aim is to win, but you have to see if it's possible.

        "document": "Killed: Jordan Brennan, 17, pictured, suffered a fatal blow to the head during a scuffle with a 16-year-old boy at a corner shop in Manchester in October . A boy who attacked and killed a teenager after interpreting his Gangnam-Style dance as 'racist' has been jailed for eight months. Jordan Brennan, 17, had broken into the dance made famous by South Korean artist Psy  at a corner shop in Gorton, Manchester. But it enraged the other boy, 16, who was shopping in the same store and thought his South East Asian ethnicity was being mocked. After claiming Jordan bumped into him as he spun round, the 16-year old attacker, who was with his girlfriend, tried to stop the victim and ordered him to apologise - but the pair became involved in a tussle. As they struggled near the doorway, Jordan fell back and hit his head on metal shutters outside the shop before his head hit the concrete floor below. The attacker then kicked him in the legs before returned to his shopping. College student Jordan got to his feet and walked home not realising he had suffered a serious head injury in the bust up. He was found lifeless in bed at 9am the following morning when his mother Kim tried to raise him for breakfast. Tests showed he had suffered a fractured skull and bleeding on the brain. At Manchester Crown Court on Friday, the killer, now 17, was jailed for eight months. The teen, who cannot be named for legal reasons, had earlier admitted manslaughter after his not guilty plea to murder was accepted. The tragedy occurred at around 7.30pm on Friday October 10 when Jordan who attended Manchester College and described as 'polite, very bubbly, happy-go-lucky type of lad' was with two friends. They went into the N.A Grocer shop on an errand but inside he began doing the Gangnam style dance and within 17 seconds there was a 'flashpoint' between him and the other teenager. Discussing the tragedy at NA Grocers, Mr Hall said CCTV in the shop captured Jordan 'dancing' in the shop before an argument took place. Weeping was audible from a public gallery packed full of Jordan's family and friends throughout prosecutor Rob Hall's opening address. He said: 'In a relatively short period of time, the defendant is in the queue at the checkout, Jordan is waiting around while others are in the check out queue and while he is waiting he proceeds to dance. 'That dance was accompanied by a reference to the well-known song Gangnam Style. 'It appears that this defendant perceived that dancing and reference as being a racist slur upon him. Jordan is of good character and so to that extent there is nothing to suggest he had racist intentions in any way. 'Needless to say that raised the defendant and he began to remonstrate about what happened. As they went to the exit door the two came into physical contact with the defendant raising his hands and pushing and pulling and in effect the physical contact put Jordan to the ground outside the exit and regrettably the back of his head made heavy contact with paving slabs outside. Jordan (pictured) fell back and hit his head on metal shutters outside the shop before his head hit the concrete floor below . Jordan Brennan had broken into the dance made famous by South Korean artist Psy whilst in high spirits at a corner shop (pictured) in Gorton, Manchester . 'Within a relatively short period of time the incident ended. The defendant was outside for 18 seconds. The whole thing lasted less than 18 seconds. 'The defendant returned back to the store to pay for his shopping and was only absent from the queue for 24 seconds which reflects how fleeting this incident was.' The court was told that the defendant, a straight-A student, had no idea he had caused any injury until he saw coverage of Jordan's death in newspapers and on TV. Jordan returned to his home which was just minutes from the shop and told his mother he was feeling unwell, it was said. The incident happened on October 10 when Jordan was with two friends . Tragically, his mother became so concerned upon his appearance and knowledge of the incident that she suggested they call an ambulance, but Jordan did not want to go to hospital. Mr Hall added: 'Jordan, being as he was, said even if his mother called an ambulance he would send it away. It is regrettable he in effect was not medically examined at the time. 'He had been sick at about midnight and again Jordan was asserting he was fine and wanted to be left alone. It is with much regret and feelings of guilt that she did not do more.' Jordan was checked on by his mother at 3.30am at which point he was sound asleep but when the family rose for the day at around 9am he was unresponsive in bed. Paramedics arrived just six minutes later but it was clear he had been dead for some time. The impact of his head hitting the pavement following the attack fractured his skull and caused bleeding on the brain. Had he been treated in hospital, he could have survived his injuries, it was said. In mitigation, Kate Blackwell QC said: 'This is a case which has led to a tragic outcome for two families. The death of Jordan was in any view devastating for his family. 'It doesn't take much to imagine for those of us who haven't lost any young family member to understand the pain and wretched loss that prevails when this happens. This case has in other ways been a terrible ordeal for the defendant and his family.' The court heard the teenager moved to the UK at the age of nine, from his native Mongolia, and excelled in his studies, receiving exemplary references from his teachers and peers which were put forward at court. She added: 'He is polite, respectful, bright, kind, with an impeccable manner. He loved school and the whole experience was grabbed by both hands. 'This was a chance encounter and his reaction to that situation was not thought by anyone to be serious and there was certainly no intention to cause serious harm and none was expected to be caused.' At Manchester Crown Court on Friday, the killer, now 17, was jailed for eight months. Pictured are floral tributes left outside the Brennan home . Sentencing him to eight months in youth custody, Judge David Stockdale said: 'Your assault on him was quite inexcusable. Your mood of aggression was demonstrated first by your pursuit of him out of the shop and by subsequently kicking him after he fell. 'You had everything going for you. But so did Jordan Brennan. A boy of 17, happy, healthy, a young boy of good character, he too had everything going for him. 'This case serves as a reminder if a reminder was necessary of the lethal consequences, unforeseeable consequences, that so often follow as a result of what might be described as low-level violence. 'Despite all of the mitigating factors I have heard and read and taken into account, I reach the conclusion that the sentence of this court must be custodial.' In a statement Jordan's mother said: 'Our son Jordan Brennan was 17 years old and was a well liked young man. He was a loveable rogue and was always polite and keen to help anyone who needed his help, be that physical help or just to listen to a friend. 'He would cheer them up with his usual larking about or joking around. He was a pleasure to have as a son and his loss is devastating. He was greatly loved by all that knew him.'",

The Warriors, who go into Friday's home game against Wakefield on the back of just two wins from their first six matches, have spent two days on a shared training camp at Orrell with Mike Ford's Premiership outfit. Wane, who reciprocated Bath's hospitality from last August, says his kickers picked up tips from their rugby union counterparts and that all his players will have benefited from lining up against the unknown in opposed training sessions. Wigan Warriors head coach Shaun Wane has been pleased with his side's training sessions with Bath . 'They looked after us last year at Bath and when we came back we went on a decent run in the play-offs so it paid off,' Wane said. 'We wanted to return the favour and we've had a great couple of days with them. 'We're running against players who don't know our systems so it's been really beneficial. We run against our 19s every day and they know what we're going to do so it's been a big help that way. 'We're trying to get benefits for both clubs. It was important to me that we got something out of and it wasn't all about them learning from us.' Bath head coach Mike Ford invited Wigan to come train with his side at the Rec in August .",

        "document": "(CNN)Astronauts on the International Space Station completed a spacewalk Sunday despite the appearance of water inside an astronaut's helmet, NASA reported. In a tweet, the space agency said astronaut Terry Virts experienced water inside his helmet, just as he did Wednesday, but \"it's a known issue; no concern.\" The spacewalk lasted five hours and 38 minutes, NASA said. \"Crews have now spent a total of 1,171 hours and 29 minutes conducting space station assembly and maintenance during 187 spacewalks,\" the agency said in a release. NASA previously said the suit worn by NASA astronaut Virts has a history of \"sublimator water carryover.\" Water in the sublimator cooling component can condense when the suit is repressurized after a spacewalk, causing a small amount of water to push into the helmet, NASA said. NASA said International Space Station managers had \"a high degree of confidence\" in the suit. On the upcoming spacewalk, Virts and Barry Wilmore installed antennas to provide data to visiting vehicles and deploy 400 feet of cable along the edge of the station. Virts said he first noticed traces of fluid and dampness in his helmet Wednesday while he was waiting for the crew lock cabin to repressurize. He and Wilmore had been outside  the space station for nearly seven hours working on the station's robotic arm and performing some maintenance. Virts immediately alerted  fellow astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti about the water, and she alerted Mission Control in Houston. Cristoforetti helped Virts out of his helmet and examined it. She confirmed the presence of moisture, mostly in the helmet absorption pad, or HAP, describing it as \"wet and cold.\" At the request of Mission Control, Anton Shkaplerov used a syringe to draw as much water as he could from the top of the helmet.  Water had collected in the white plastic at the top and around both ear cups.  Shkaplerov estimated there was 15 milliliters of water in the helmet. That's a far cry from the amount of water that accumulated in Luca Parmitano's suit during a spacewalk in July 2013.  Between 1 and 1.5 liters of water backed up in the suit and helmet, prompting fears Parmitano could drown in his own helmet.  The spacewalk was cut short, and NASA implemented some changes to its suits, including the addition of absorbent padding in helmets. There was another intrusion of water into the helmet during another spacewalk on December 24, 2013.  NASA commentator Rob Navias said it was noticed at the same point in the mission as Wednesday's leak -- during the repressurization of the crew lock, the area from which astronauts enter and exit ISS while in space.",

        "document": "The U.S. could face a shortage of 90,000 doctors by 2025 as it struggles to cope with an older, sicker population and increased demand from Obamacare, a new report has warned. The dire need\u00a0for doctors, particularly surgeons treating diseases common among elderly people, such as cancer, was revealed by the\u00a0Association of American Medical Colleges on Tuesday. 'The doctor shortage is real \u2013 it's significant \u2013 and it's particularly serious for the kind of medical care that our aging population is going to need,' said Darrell G. Kirch, CEO and president of AAMC, which represents medical schools and teaching hospitals across the country. In its 2015 report, the association found that even though the supply of doctors will increase between now and 2015, the demand for physician services will fast out-grow this supply. Struggle: A graph shows the predicted demand for doctors compared to the predicted supply between 2013 and 2015. The demand is thanks to \u00a0the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and retail clinics, among other factors . Problem: The greatest shortage will be for surgeons, particularly those treating diseases among the elderly . The  number of physicians is expected to grow by nine per cent over the next ten years, but the demand for healthcare services could grown by up to 17 percent. It predicted there could be a shortfall of between 46,100 and 90,400 doctors in 10 years' time and, of these, there could be a shortage of as many as 63,700 non-primary care physicians. This is also considering how retail clinics and outpatient centers are turning more to nurse practitioners, physician assistants and other professionals instead of physicians, the report noted. When looking at the cause behind the increased demand, the association pointed to increased life expectancy. 'An increasingly older, sicker population, as well as people living longer with chronic diseases, such as cancer, is the reason for the increased demand,' Kirch told the Washington Post. The number of people over the age of 65 will soar by 40 percent by 2025, he said. The association also noted that the implementation of the Affordable Care Act will likely increase demand. But it will do so only minimally - increasing the need for doctors by two per cent. 'The trends from these data are clear,' Kirch said in a statement. 'The physician shortage will grow over the next 10 years under every likely scenario. Demands: The Association of American Medical Colleges, which compiled the report, has called upon the government to pay to train 3,000 more physicians a year in a bid to meet the growing demand . 'Because training a doctor takes between five and 10 years, we must act now, in 2015, if we are going to avoid serious physician shortages in 2025.' He called for more efficient care and more federal support to train at least 3,000 more students a year - at an estimated cost of $1 billion a year. The association did note that the shortfalls aren't as bad as predictions in the past; in a 2010 study, they said there would be a shortage of 130,600 physicians. The difference in predictions is thanks to revised population numbers and the slight rise in doctors completing medical school. The AAMC, which is based in Washington, D.C., represents all 141 U.S. medical schools and 17 in Canada, and 400 major teaching hospitals and health systems.",

        "document": "Former BBC boss\u00a0Greg Dyke has branded Jeremy Clarkson a 'disaster waiting to happen' amid claims the presenter punched a Top Gear producer. The FA Chairman said the BBC has been placed in an impossible position and 'can't win either way' whatever the outcome of the\u00a0Top Gear Inquiry. Clarkson,\u00a0who is currently suspended after allegedly hitting Oisin Tymon in a row over hot food,\u00a0has reportedly promised to sue the BBC if he is sacked from the popular show. Speaking to ITV News today, Mr Dyke said: 'First of all I'd say that I don't think Jeremy Clarkson is the first presenter I've met who would have liked to have thumped his producer. Scroll down for video . Former BBC boss Greg Dyke (right) has branded Jeremy Clarkson (left) a 'disaster waiting to happen' amid claims the presenter punched a Top Gear producer . 'But in truth he is a disaster waiting to happen really for the BBC. It's hard to\u2026I'm glad I'm not the executive who has to take that decision because if you were, you can't win either way now.' The\u00a0former BBC Director General added:\u00a0'Even if you decide to keep Jeremy\u2026what happens next?' Clarkson allegedly believes that the BBC have launched a 'smear campaign' against him which he 'won't let go'. Sources close to the 54-year-old have said he is likely to take action against the Corporation for wrongful dismissal, if he is not reinstated to the programme. It comes amid reports that the BBC are filming a pilot of a new motoring show called The Getaway Car, which will see contestants travel abroad to take part in driving challenges. Clarkson was suspended two weeks ago following allegations of 'a fracas', prompting the top-rating show to be pulled off air. The four Top Gear roadshows scheduled for Norway next weekend have been postponed. Tickets for the postponed shows cost between \u00a342 and \u00a3100, meaning the decision could cost the BBC more than \u00a31million in lost revenue if Clarkson is sacked and the shows are not rescheduled. Sacking Clarkson could mean the end of Top Gear, which makes the BBC millions every year . Speculation about his future has been mounting and will be decided this week when the corporation's internal investigation into his behaviour is handed over to the director-general. The BBC\u2019s internal inquiry into Clarkson\u2019s fracas with Mr Oisin is expected to made public as soon as Tuesday. It is being led by Ken MacQuarrie, the head of BBC Scotland who oversaw the investigation into the disastrous Newsnight edition that falsely accused the late Conservative peer Lord McAlpine of being involved in the north Wales child abuse scandal. The presenter launched an extraordinary foul-mouthed rant at BBC bosses during a charity gala last week. Speaking at an event in north London to raise money to help disadvantaged youths, Clarkson said that he wanted to do one more lap of the show's track 'before the 'f****** b******* sack me'. He said: 'I didn't foresee my sacking, but I would like to do one last lap. So I'll go down to Surrey and I'll do one last lap of that track before the f****** b******* sack me. 'I'll be a bit tearful when I do it, but f*** it, let's do it. And I'll drive somebody around in whatever I can get hold of. I'm sacked so it's probably an Austin Maestro.' But the under-fire presenter claimed that the 'sweary' incident had all been in good humour. Writing in his column in the Sunday Times, he said: 'I woke up after a night at a charity do to be told by my lawyer that someone had uploaded a video of me using choice language to describe bosses at the BBC. 'But it was all meant in jest and anyway it worked. By being brief, controversial and a bit sweary I woke the room up and the auction prize I was offering - one last lap of the Top Gear test track - raised \u00a3100,000.' Clarkson, pictured with co ho-hosts James May and Richard Hammond at a Top Gear Live show in Prague, will not be performing at the four events in Norway as they have been cancelled . Clarkson was suspended two weeks ago following allegations of 'a fracas' with Top Gear producer Oisin Tymon (right), prompting the top-rating show to be pulled off air . The Top Gear frontman revealed that he has been 'put on silence' which is why he has been refusing to comment on the allegations. He said: 'I've been put on silence. There are very good reasons from my point of view why I simply can't say a word.' Insiders suggested Clarkson and Mr Tymon had given \u2018quite different\u2019 versions of events. Sources close to Mr Tymon say he was punched and left with a split lip, while Clarkson has admitted some \u2018handbags and pushing\u2019 but is understood to have denied anything worse. The BBC was given a reminder of the strength of support behind Clarkson when a million-strong petition calling for his reinstatement was delivered to its headquarters - by tank. The vehicle, apparently driven by the motoring show's enigmatic professional driver The Stig, made its way from Westminster, through central London and towards New Broadcasting House near Oxford Street. Fans were pictured rallying to support the delivery of the Change.org petition, started by political website Guido Fawkes. There is also said to be a growing realisation within the corporation that it was a mistake to take Top Gear \u2013 worth \u00a350million a year to BBC coffers \u2013 off the air while the investigation was under way . The petition, launched last week, reads: 'We the undersigned petition the BBC to reinstate Jeremy Clarkson. Freedom to fracas. #BringBackClarkson'.' It emerged yesterday that a report into Clarkson's behaviour was commissioned by BBC head of TV Danny Cohen after a series of other scandals last year. Top Gear caused an international incident after driving through Argentina with a number plate allegedly linked to the Falklands War and used the word 'slope' describe an Asian man. A report into the cases apparently concluded that Top Gear should have a new producer role to act as a go-between the show's team and the BBC's management to help deal with any future crisis. The BBC today refused to comment on the report or its conclusions. There is also said to be a growing realisation within the corporation that it was a mistake to take Top Gear \u2013 worth \u00a350million a year to BBC coffers \u2013 off the air while the investigation was under way. \u2018The programme could and should have carried on during Clarkson\u2019s suspension,\u2019 said an insider. \u2018Jeremy wants to stay with the programme and one possible way of him doing that would be if he could face up to his own shortcomings. \u2018He has a great deal of public support... But he does need to rest and sort himself out.\u2019 David Cameron's 11-year-old daughter Nancy has gone on hunger strike in protest at the presenter's suspension from Top Gear. She has threatened not to eat until the  presenter was restored to the BBC One show. Mr Cameron said: 'Nancy has threatened to go on hunger strike unless Jeremy Clarkson is restored. 'We told her that this is not necessarily a useful intervention - he\u2019s not exactly Gandhi.'",

        "document": "Jerusalem (CNN)In a sea of Jewish parties campaigning at Hebrew University, Ayman Odeh was the star attraction. But this powerful new face in Israeli politics is not Jewish. While he is an Israeli citizen, the charismatic 41-year-old lawyer is of Palestinian descent -- one of 1.6 million Israeli Arabs living in Israel. Under Odeh's leadership, Israel's tiny, splintered Arab parties have teamed up for the first time to form a slate known as the Joint List. Come election day on Tuesday, they are poised to take as many as 15 seats. This could potentially make them the third-largest party in the Knesset after Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party and his main rival, the Zionist Camp coalition, potentially giving them the balance of power. It is a game-changer, giving a significant voice to one-fifth of the population that has long complained of being treated as second-class citizens. His most immediate goal is to deny a new term to Netanyahu, who he says has led the \"most racist government in history.\" \"Netanyahu says the danger to Israel is not Palestinians in the West Bank, but rather Arabs in Israel. What is that telling me as a citizen of Haifa?\" he asked in an interview on Saturday. \"With 15 seats in the Knesset, no one will ever be able to ignore us again.\" Until now, Arab parties have failed to unite because of deep ideological differences. They run the spectrum from communist to Islamist. But a law passed by the last Knesset, sponsored by the right-wing party of Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman, raised the threshold of votes a party must receive to be admitted to the Knesset. Many believed Lieberman's goal was to push the Arab parties out of the Knesset. It's a theory that was given credence when, in recent televised debate, Lieberman warned Odeh, \"You are here for now.\" \"Why are you even here?\" Leiberman said to Odeh. Baiting him by accusing him of \"representing terror groups,\" Lieberman turned to Odeh and said, \"You're not wanted here.\" Odeh politely noted that his Joint List was polling well ahead of Lieberman's party. \"I'm very wanted in my homeland,\" he said. \"I'm part of the scenery. I resemble it.\" With that calm, dignified response, Odeh attracted political star status among Jews and Arabs alike. At the Hebrew University forum, event students campaigning for the Labor Party and the left-wing Meretz Party wanted to take selfies with him. More importantly, he has given hope to the 1.6 million Palestinians who hold Israeli citizenship that they might finally enjoy social and economic equality. In the Wadi Nisnas neighborhood of Haifa where Odeh grew up, the shopkeepers and restaurant owners welcome him as a native son. Odeh goes door to door with the ease of a natural politician, speaking about the importance of turning out to vote to ensure the Joint List gets enough seats to change the face of the Israeli government. Over hummus and stuffed vegetables, he speaks about a 10-year plan to close the social gaps between Israel's Jews and its Arab population, speaking about issues such as education, housing, employment for women, public transportation in Arab towns and recognition of unrecognized Bedouin communities in the Negev. Growing up, he says he identified with Malcolm X. But as he got older, he began to feel he should follow in the footsteps of Martin Luther King Jr. With a large block in parliament, Odeh says he would have a greater platform to press for better treatment of Palestinians in the occupied territories and to speak out about the need for a Palestinian state living beside Israel. \"What makes people vote is the hope of change,\" he said. \"We have been ceding hope again and again. But we are 20% of the population. We can prevent the right from forming a government.\" There is some skepticism here that Arabs will finally have a say in how the government is run, but most are hopeful. Sitting on a stoop chopping celery stalks for the grocery store across the street, Sami Abuliat says Odeh is a good spokesman for Palestinians living inside Israel. \"We've asked for so many rights we don't we won't get,\" Abuilat says. \"The big eat the small. But united, we can be strong. This is a good first step.\" If, as many expect, Likud or Labor fail to strike deals with smaller parties to get the 61 seats needed to form a government, they may be forced to join together in a \"national unity\" government. That would make the next biggest group of parties, and Odeh, the official opposition. It's a position he says he would prefer over joining an Israeli government, which he says dedicates a large chunk of its budget to policies that discriminate against the Palestinians. The Prime Minister is required to brief the leader of the opposition at least once a month on diplomatic and security matters. Odeh would be entitled to a seat on Israel's foreign affairs committee in the Knesset and is obligated to address the Knesset after every speech by the Prime Minister. He would also protected by the Shin Bet security service. He would have the ear of foreign leaders, who would reach out and meet with him to hear his views. Odeh says he needs the help of Israeli Jews, who he hopes one day will become a greater voice in the cause of social justice for all Israelis. \"Arabs alone cannot make a democracy strong. It has to be Arabs and Jews,\" he says. \"My dream is one day we will build a real Arab-Jew party, and I tell Jews to come join us and build a true democratic party in this country.\" It's a message that resonates back at Hebrew University, where some Jewish students are joining the fight against what they call institutional discrimination in Israel. \"It is not only a struggle of the Palestinian minority living in Israel. It is the struggle of the Palestinian minority together with democratic Jews like myself,\" says Ofer, a student with the Jewish communist Hadash party. It's not a vision shared by most in Israel, but Odeh's message to students is \"this is your chance.\" By finding their voice and using their vote, he says, they can make the dream of equality a reality.",

'This is not a personal issue. I think that it is important . for every country in its relationship with the United States to . recognize that the U.S. has a process of making policy,' Obama . said. But Obama said Netanyahu had been wrong before with his . opposition to a 2013 interim deal with Iran. Israel fears that Obama's Iran diplomacy, with an end-of-March deadline for a framework nuclear agreement, will still allow its arch-foe to develop an atom bomb . 'Netanyahu made all sorts of claims. This was going to be a . terrible deal. This was going to result in Iran getting 50 . billion dollars worth of relief. Iran would not abide by the . agreement. None of that has come true. 'It has turned out that in fact, during this period we've . seen Iran not advance its program. In many ways, it's rolled . back elements of its program.' The White House last week denied a report that the United . States and Iran were exploring a possible 10-year deal that . would initially freeze Iran's nuclear program but gradually . allow it to increase activities that could enable it to produce . nuclear arms in the last years of the agreement. In a speech on Monday to the American Israel Public Affairs . Committee (AIPAC), the largest U.S. pro-Israel lobby, Netanyahu . again warned that a nuclear deal could threaten Israel's . survival while insisting the U.S.-Israeli relationship was . 'stronger than ever.' Asked about the prospects for a final deal with Iran, which . has a June 30 deadline, Obama said that a key doubt was whether . Iran would agree to rigorous inspection demands and the low . levels of uranium enrichment capability they would have to . maintain. 'But if they do agree to it, it would be far more effective . in controlling their nuclear program than any military action we . could take, any military action Israel could take and far more . effective than sanctions will be,' Obama said. A comprehensive nuclear deal is seen as crucial to reducing . the risk of a wider Middle East war, at a time when Iran is . deeply involved in conflicts in Syria and Iraq.",

        "document": "It is a common problem for airlines, ferries and cruise ships - how do you make\u00a0passengers\u00a0pay attention to the\u00a0safety briefing? Condor Ferries believes it has found the solution, producing a video complete with a rapping captain and dancing staff that certainly attracts attention. Doing away with the monotone yet informative messages usually portrayed in safety briefings, the Portsmouth-based company said it wanted to inject some 'fun' into this year's offering. But not everybody is a fan, with some\u00a0commentators\u00a0saying they would prefer to jump overboard than listen to the\u00a0song. The captain introduces the rap for a very different safety demonstration . Condor Ferries have produced the safety rap as part of their 'Good Times' branding . Slightly out of sync and with some incredibly cringeworthy dance moves, the video seems to have done the trick and has already been viewed nearly 20,000 times since it was posted on YouTube several days ago. The video begins with a captain sporting blue sunglasses and some questionable moves as he announces: 'To ensure you have good times on board, please listen up to the following safety message from Condor Ferries.' It's soon time for the crew to get involved as they raise their hands in the air singing, 'life jackets, life jackets, they're right beneath your seat.' The pair then instruct those watching how to operate the life jacket. 'It clips together so easily just listen for the click,' sings the female. 'That means you've done it properly and you look so very hip.' That may be a matter of opinion. The steward raps how to fix the life jacket on and blow the whistle, all out of sync . All you have to do is just 'listen for the click' says the stewardess, and that means you've done it right . The male then takes the lead when notifying of where the emergency exits are, complete with some cringeworthy dance moves that involve bouncing on the spot and hilarious hand signals. But it only gets worse. It's back to the captain, as he comes into shot singing 'now ladies, hey ladies,' while making what can only be described as an 'uncomfortable' facial expression. However, rather than flirting, he is simply advising that 'sharp objects can't go on our slides, so leave those heels behind.' The steward then bounces on the spot and uses amusing hand gestures to warn of the emergency exits . The emergency slide is then shown, at least in graphic form, as the stewardess demonstrates how, well, to slide down it. The video then uses graphics to show how the staff can help passengers from wheeling their luggage, to using a resuscitator and defibrillator, as 'you name it, we have it.' The star of the show then comes back, the captain, as he sings: 'So who would have thought that the Condor could bust out such good rhymes?' The video is being broadcast  on all sailings between Poole and the Channel Islands. He's back! The captain then makes a somewhat unnerving re-appearance as he warns ladies not use heels down the emergency slides . The idea was conceived and produced by Bournemouth-based Walker Agency, working closely with the Condor Ferries safety, marine operations and marketing teams. Alicia Andrews, executive director \u2013 commercial at Condor Ferries, said: 'We're really proud of the new safety video, it's been a very fun project to work on, and we're delighted with the results. 'Our brief was simple, we wanted something a little bit different, something that our passengers would sit up and take notice of, and which would appeal to all members of the family. We think that the rap, with the Good Times messaging does just that. The stewardess demonstrates how passengers would use the emergency slide... not too difficult . 'Ferry travel is very family-friendly, there are no restrictions on the amount of luggage you can bring \u2013 you can pack everything in to your car, and off you go. 'We hope that our passengers, whether they are frequent travellers or joining us for the first time this summer will enjoy the video and their Good Times experience onboard Condor Liberation as we set sail to Jersey and Guernsey.' However the video has been met with less-than positive comments by users on YouTube, where it has been hosted. The staff are there to help with passengers' every need, according to the safety video . Liam Gilheany wrote: 'I want to pour lava into my ears,' while James Lund added: 'I'd want to jump into the harbour if this is for real.' Nathan Thomas is somewhat dubious as to the authenticity of the captain writing: 'I hope they keep a look out for fishing boats better - now they seem to have employed a stripper as a captain.' Condor are believed to be the first ferry operator to produce an onboard safety video to feature a rap. The release has coincided with the launch of its brand new state-of-the-art Condor Liberation with a new mission statement of 'Good Times.' The video has been met with pleasure by senior executives at Condor Ferries .",

        "document": "The babysitter of murder suspect Aaron Hernandez testified he kissed her in a bedroom at his Massachusetts 'flophouse' two night before he is alleged to have killed Odin Lloyd. According to the babysitter, 28-year-old Jennifer Fortier, Hernandez paid her $250 two days later after she babysat for just four hours. That sum equates to $62.50 an hour, a marked increase of her usual rate of $20 per hour. Scroll down for video . Jennifer Fortier, 28, testified she ran into Aaron Hernandez while she was out with a friend in Boston two nights before he is accused of murdering Odin Lloyd . Hernandez, 25, is accused of shooting Lloyd. He is being tried at Bristol County Superior Court in Fall River, Massachusetts.\u00a0If convicted, Hernandez faces a maximum penalty of life in prison . Fortier said he kissed her in a bedroom and then she stopped him and left. Two days later, he paid her $250 . Fortier said she ran into Hernandez on the night of of June 14, 2013, when she and a girlfriend were out in Boston. After they left with Hernandez, Lloyd and a third man, they eventually wound up in his apartment in Franklin. The prosecution commonly refers to that apartment as a 'flophouse'. They were in a bedroom at the apartment when Hernandez kissed her. Hernandez had a $41 million contract with the New England Patriots before he was released . She said: 'I pushed him away,' 'I told him, \"I'm your Nanny. I can't do this.\" 'He understood and said it was OK.' Fortier did admit that she initially kissed Hernandez back before rebuffing him and departing. Two nights later, Fortier said she was babysitting at the home of Hernandez and his fianc\u00e9e, Shayanna Jenkins when two men identified as Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz arrived around midnight while the couple were out. Prosecutors have alleged the three men picked up  Lloyd, a semi-professional football player who was dating Jenkins' sister, at his Boston home early on June 17, 2013, and drove him to the industrial area where his bullet-riddled body was found later that day. Hernandez, 25, is accused of fatally shooting Lloyd and is being tried at Bristol County Superior Court in Fall River, Massachusetts. Wallace and Ortiz also face murder charges and will be tried separately. All three men have pleaded not guilty. If convicted, Hernandez, a former tight-end for the New England Patriots, faces a maximum penalty of life in prison. Surveillance video played in court showed Wallace and Ortiz arriving at the house in North Attleborough, Massachusetts, and Fortier answering the door. The $250 sum equates to a rate of $62.50 an hour, a marked increase of Fortier's usual pay of $20 per hour . They arrived in what prosecutors say was a rented Nissan Altima that they later drove to the crime scene. Fortier said Hernandez or Jenkins called her cell phone within 10-15 minutes of their arrival, and that she handed the phone to Wallace, who walked into the kitchen to talk before giving her the phone back. After Hernandez and Jenkins returned, Hernandez went upstairs quickly before leaving with the men at around 1am, she said. Fortier said she talked with Jenkins for about an hour before leaving. Hernandez had a $41 million contract with the Patriots. He was released from the team hours after his arrest in June, 2013.",

As first lady of the United States she can be nothing but the epitome of grace, elegance and politeness as she mingles with world leaders and celebrities at the White House and further afield. But it was not always so for Michelle Obama, who as a child was so foul-mouthed she lost out on an award at summer camp aged 10, according to a new biography. The first lady-to-be was an avid attendee at a day camp on the shores of Lake Michigan, and stood out as the most capable in her age group. But camp leaders were so taken aback by her salty tongue that they denied her a prestigious award when the camp ended, according to biographer Peter Slevin, whose Michelle Obama: A Life was previewed by\u00a0People magazine.

The anecdote surfaced in the upcoming book on Mrs Obama, which also includes the revelation that her mother\u00a0was anxious about her marriage\u00a0to future president Barack Obama \u2013 because he is mixed race rather than completely black. Slevin quotes her as saying: 'I was going through my cursing stage.' 'I didn't realize until my camp counselor at the end came up and said: \"You know, you would have been best camper in your age group, but you curse so much\".' 'And I thought I was being cool.' Mrs. Obama used to attend the camp regularly with her brother, Craig. She would have been ten years old at the camp held in 1974, while Craig would have been 11. Revelation: The anecdote about the young Michelle Obama (pictured right aged seven), emerged in the upcoming biography Michelle Obama: A Life by Peter Slevin, due out April 7 .

Like the rodent he keeps as a pet, Pavel has grown accustomed to a subterranean existence after nine months living in a basement where he eats, sleeps and plays. Accompanied by his family and a group of others who have seen their city descend into a war zone, the young boy takes refuge from the ever-present threat of stray bullets and artillery fire. Waiting for lunch:\u00a0Pavel Makeev, age 5, peeks his head through a doorway while waiting for his lunch to be cooked in Donetsk, Ukraine . Pavel and his family live in the\u00a0basement of the cultural centre in Petrovskiy, an area of Donetsk  under pro-Russian rebel control, and the city above him has seen months of heavy and terrifying clashes between Ukrainian troops and rebels. Since the February 15 ceasefire, fighting may have eased but it has  not stopped\u00a0altogether. The thump of artillery fire and the rattle of automatic guns still echo through a bleak landscape of fallen trees and splintered houses. Going home is still not a safe option. Life in the basement is simple, but with working electricity, the family have light and are able to use stoves to cook. A shabby collection of furniture and materials salvaged from buildings above decorates their underground home. Much of the natural light that the few windows allow in is blocked by protective sandbags. The desperate family are just a few of the thousands of civilians who were forced to flee their homes because of the conflict - which began in April 2014 after Kiev sent its military to the southeastern regions that refused to recognize the new authorities in the capital. Nearly a year of fighting has led to at least 5,793 deaths, according to UN estimates. Another 14,595 people have been wounded in the conflict. New life: The young boy\u00a0holds his pet, Masha, who lives with him in his underground home in the Petrovskiy neighborhood of Donetsk . Basic amenities: Pavel and his family were forced to flee their home and move to the squalid basement for their own safety . Underground existence: Beneath the city, Pavel and his sister Raya are safer from the constant threat of stray bullets and artillery fire . Harsh environment: People have been living in this basement since June 2014, two months after the conflict in Ukraine began . Light relief: The basement has working electricity, meaning the children can watch television while they take refuge from the fighting . Ruined building:\u00a0An apartment in the neighbourhood is destroyed and abandoned after being hit by artillery rounds in Donetsk, Ukraine . Living area: The haphazard collection of furniture provides the inhabitants of the basement with what little comfort they have . Makeshift bed: Most of the beds consist of pieces of material and furniture salvaged from the war-torn city above . Children's bedroom: Two bunk beds are set up for youngsters in the\u00a0basement of the Petrovskiy neighborhood cultural centre . Makeshift kitchen:\u00a0Electric burners are used to cook food for the inhabitants of the basement as they take refuge from fighting in Donetsk . Making the best of it:\u00a0Eleonora Tsvetaeva makes a rare trip home since the ceasefire between Ukrainian soldiers and pro-Russian rebels . Household chores:\u00a0A woman named Lubov empties dirty water into a canister after making a lunch of oat pancakes in the basement home .
